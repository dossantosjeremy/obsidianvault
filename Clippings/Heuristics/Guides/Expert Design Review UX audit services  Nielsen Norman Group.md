When you engage Nielsen Norman Group for an expert design review, our experienced usability researcher inspects your interface for usability issues and areas for improvement. We rate how well your site or application adheres to best practices and user interface principles to make the findings actionable.

A thorough design review is especially useful if you're trying to decide on a new strategy for your user experience. Our independent position allows us to evaluate your designs from a fresh perspective.

Even if you're not planning to change direction, it's still valuable to commission an independent UX assessment periodically to reduce risk. Expert reviews ensure there's nothing major you've overlooked by being too close to the design.

## What to Expect

We conduct a detailed analysis of your interface to identify the strengths and weaknesses. The specific areas we review depends on the project goals. However, the themes usually involve usability heuristics that we developed, such as consistency and standards, error prevention, and user control and freedom. We rate the findings by severity level to help you and your team prioritize the work.

Unlike traditional usability testing, which requires recruiting and more upfront planning, design reviews can be completed faster, usually within 2-3 weeks.

## Deliverables

The report contains detailed findings and recommended solutions for improving the user experience and meeting business goals.

Reports are usually 60-100 pages and include 50-100 recommendations, prioritized by severity. The evaluation is detailed and filled with examples with callouts, discussions of best practices, and actionable recommendations.

We customize our deliverables to serve your needs. You choose the format. We can deliver results as written documents or slide decks.

## Pricing

- Single Platform (website, intranet, or application): $45K USD, can vary depending on complexity
- Multi-Platform (2-3 screen sizes): $58,000-68,000 USD
- Competitive Review (Your website + 3 competitors): $80,000 USD

**Research-backed recommendations:** We draw on our extensive, global research conducted with thousands of different interface designs, and observing thousands of people. We know what works and what doesn't work.

**Vendor-independence:** We don't have a vested interest in recommending one approach or technology over another. We invented many of the usability methodologies used in these reviews and have used them for decades, so we can make sound conclusions.

**Fresh perspective:** As outside experts, we deliver an unbiased verdict that purely supports what's best for you and your customers.
