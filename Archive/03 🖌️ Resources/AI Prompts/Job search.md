just unlocked a really cool new use case for [Perplexity](https://www.linkedin.com/company/perplexity-ai?trk=feed-detail_main-feed-card-text) for the job search. I created a prompt to (1) identify important things in the job description, (2) search the internet for information about that organization that relates to those important things, and (3) put all of that information into a table. In just a few seconds, I now have everything I need to research the company as I prepare for the interview. Here's the prompt I created (obviously replacing the bracketed phrases with the relevant information). It could be more succinct but I'm embracing the natural language. Note that when I tried to attach a file with the job description instead of paste the contents into the search, the algorithm kept returning a table where all of its cited sources were that file. It wouldn't create a table with website links until I changed it to the prompt below. Prompt: Below is the job description for an [role] for [department] at [university]. I want to search for information about the Department that is relevant to me as I prepare to interview for this role specifically. Think step-by-step. First, review the job description, analyzing for key points. Then, based on the analysis, prepare a "grocery list"' of aspects of the Department and University that would be valuable to learn more about. Next, print your grocery list. Then, search the internet for information about the Department and the University and map that information on to the grocery list. Finally, put this information into a table and cite your sources, including links in a separate column on the table linking to an internet-based resources.
