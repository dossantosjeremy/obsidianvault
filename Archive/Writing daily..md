* Working on setting my own business. I feel I need to have a strong presence online first. So my plan is to finish my portfolio. Put it online. Create some profile and get a first client. 
* I feel a bit stuck. I know I can tell about what I did and what were my projects, but I am not sure how to introduce myself, what is my mission, values, vision... all of that needs to be defined and I am not sure how to do it well. 
* I also want to learn more about using AI more frequently in my job. 
* Use it to learn, to be more efficient. 
* I want to learn more about UX, People Management and Product Management. I feel this is a lot. How can we use the time to the best of our ability? 
* I am also passionate by automation. 
* I need to set some time, every day, doing one video about automation. Putting it in my portfolio. Talking about it. Probably I could do some jobs at automating things.
