[[Action Steps - Storytelling]]

# Why storytelling Matters

- It creates a more engaging and memorable experience for stakeholders and team members[1]
- It helps generate empathy for users and their needs[3]
- It can make complex data and insights more digestible and compelling[2]
- It increases buy-in for UX initiatives and research findings[2]
- The power of storytelling lies in its ability to evoke emotions and create connections.
- Moreover, storytelling in UX research is instrumental in advocating for users and increasing buy-in from stakeholders.
- As noted by the Nielsen Norman Group, stories that engage and persuade audiences can inspire action and encourage reflection, making them a powerful tool for connecting teams, stakeholders, and products.
- More accessible findings: Storytelling in UX research significantly enhances stakeholder engagement by making research findings more accessible and compelling.
- Bridging the gap between technicality and strategy When stakeholders can see the human side of data, they are more likely to understand and act upon the insights provided. This is particularly important in organizations where decision-makers may not have a background in UX or design.
- This approach also encourages collaboration and buy-in from cross-functional teams, as it aligns everyone around a shared understanding of the user experience. (NNG Group)
- Storytelling in UX research serves as a bridge between data and human experience, transforming raw insights into compelling narratives that resonate with stakeholders. (Interaction Design Foundation)

## Especially in UX Research

- Being intentional about the story you tell can help: make findings more digestible, actionable, and easy to follow; focus your stakeholders on the key findings; and above all, increase the chances that your stakeholders will act on what you are sharing. Being intentional about the story you craft is important!

# Challenges in Storytelling

- Personal bias: One common issue is the potential for bias, as researchers may inadvertently emphasize certain aspects of the user experience over others.
- Mitigate this by basing stories on comprehensive and diverse data sets.
- Making sure it is aligned with the research objectives: Another challenge is ensuring that the narrative remains focused and relevant to the research objectives.
- Ethics and privacy: Additionally, researchers must be mindful of the ethical implications of storytelling, particularly when dealing with sensitive user data. Ensuring that user privacy is protected and that stories are presented with integrity is essential for maintaining trust and credibility. (Lyft Design+)

# Techniques for a great storytelling

## Preparation

## Storytelling start way before

- Remember: Finding your story doesn’t begin at report creation. It starts in the planning stages of your study. It’s about having clarity on the learning objectives of the research and how the insights will ladder up to answering those objectives.

## Start by the content

- To take inspiration from the world of Industrial Design, _form follows function_. We always caution UXRs against starting by opening a new slide deck and adding content, because it makes you too focused on the _form_–your report, versus the _function_–your thesis. Put another way, just like any good researcher starts by identifying learning objectives before choosing a method, we want to first focus on moving from insights to story before starting on a final report.

## Prepare for storytelling content

- Use sticky notes
- Storyboard one idea per slide
- Articulate the big idea
- Go on a white board
- Gather all sources of information (other presentations, news articles, industry reports, surveys...)
- Brainstorm
- Build on new ideas and consider ideas from a new angle
- Sketch ideas
    - What do you want to say
    - How do you want to say it
- Use diagrams as much as possible and if not possible, use big text
- Throw out visual clichés (use the first ones that come to your mind)
- Use design principles to arrange slides.

## Messages to elicit change

Example messages:

- Subject = You
- Verb (action or emotion) - strong verb to elicit action
- Stake: You xxx until you xxx

## Determine a goal for storytelling

- Define clear goals for using storytelling (Listen, Care, Trust, Take Action)
- Verify if storytelling is appropriate for your specific situation
- Not every report or deliverable needs to be a story

### Research intent

- This is likely the most time-intensive part of the process and is highly dependent on your study. We recommend finding your story by re-centering yourself on two things: **Research intent** (i.e. why did you set out to do this research) and **research actionability** (i.e. what decisions is your research looking to inform). Starting here will help you establish the kind of story your report might arrive at.
- When starting the process of finding your story, we recommend first grounding yourself in your research intent. Why did your team set out to do this research? Where in the product development process is this research happening–discover, define, refine or launch?
- **Helps to filter relevant vs interesting** Leveraging this ‘decision-lens’ is important in Step 1 because it filters out insights that are **relevant vs. interesting.** Too often we find UX researchers putting all the data they collect and insights they’ve uncovered into a report in the pursuit of being thorough. Instead, anchoring on the decisions your team is trying to make can help you hone in on which insights are relevant for your story.

## Dividing the presentation

- Quick Summary of the learnings and presentation
    - Expectations agenda: Give timings and content
- Executives: 10% of the slides divided the following way:
    - High level findings
    - Recommendations
    - Conclusions
- Changes to make on the stakeholders' mind
    - Change beliefs with facts
    - Change emotions with emotional messages
    - Change behavior with recommendations

## Think about the audience

- Understand the audience
    - Why it should matter to them
    - External and internal factors at play
    - Tailor to the main group needs
    - Why are they here today
    - Who are they
    - What keeps them up
    - What do they think they will get away from this
    - Why is that important
- Segment the audience
    - Politics
    - Demographics
    - Psychographics
    - Firmographics
    - Ethnographics
- Interview stakeholders to understand their goals and needs
- Focus on metrics and outcomes that matter to them
- Align your insights with their priorities and objectives

## Storytelling Techniques

- The use of storyboards, which visually map out user interactions and highlight key moments in the user journey. Storyboards can be particularly useful in identifying pain points and opportunities for improvement.
- Another technique is the use of video and audio clips from user interviews, which can bring the user's voice directly into the research findings. These multimedia elements can make the narrative more engaging and memorable for stakeholders.
- Additionally, creating a narrative arc that includes a beginning, middle, and end can help structure the story and ensure that it is easy to follow. (Notably AI)

## Story Arcs

- Generally, a story arc is the path your story takes. A common example in UX Research is an “answers-first” type of arc — starting with an exec summary of top findings and recommendations, then backing up your points with evidence. Story arcs vary, and there are many to choose from, but in general it is important to start with the basics: a beginning, a middle, and an end.

![image.png](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/91ba1228-0e9d-4ff8-b909-71ca01bf6054/98d7235a-6248-4ff5-b8bc-86c4d8d9d1c1/image.png)

## Story Arcs when you did research at several steps

- Act one / Setup: The setup is all about understanding the background, and that’s where foundational research comes in. Foundational research (also called generative, discovery, or initial research) helps you understand users and identify their problems. You’re learning about what exists today, the challenges users have, and how the challenges affect them—just like in the movies. To do foundational research, you can conduct contextual inquiries or diary studies (or both!), which can help you start to identify problems as well as opportunities. It doesn’t need to be a huge investment in time or money.
- Act 2 - conflict: Act two is all about digging deeper into the problems that you identified in act one. This usually involves directional research, such as usability tests, where you assess a potential solution (such as a design) to see whether it addresses the issues that you found. The issues could include unmet needs or problems with a flow or process that’s tripping users up. Like act two in a movie, more issues will crop up along the way. It’s here that you learn more about the characters as they grow and develop through this act.

## **Make use of comparisons**

- No matter what story arc you choose, consider including **comparisons** as a key element. Detailing “what is” and “what could be” is a way to easily highlight challenges and opportunities. In early stage research, this might be comparing current-state vs desired future-states, while in later stage research, this might be contrasting potential solutions.
- Create tension between status quo and possibilities
- Use contrast to drive engagement
- Build momentum through alternating patterns
- End with inspiration rather than obligation
- The fundamental principle is maintaining a dynamic tension between "what is" and "what could be" throughout the presentation, while building toward an inspiring vision of change.

## Basic Narrative Structure for UX Research

- Act one: You meet the protagonists (the users) and the antagonists (the problems affecting users). This is the beginning of the plot. In act one, researchers might use methods including contextual inquiry, ethnography, diary studies, surveys, and analytics. The output of these methods can include personas, empathy maps, user journeys, and analytics dashboards.
- Act two: Next, there’s character development. There’s conflict and tension as the protagonists encounter problems and challenges, which they must overcome. In act two, researchers might use methods including usability testing, competitive benchmarking, and heuristics evaluation. The output of these can include usability findings reports, UX strategy documents, usability guidelines, and best practices.
- Act three: The protagonists triumph and you see what a better future looks like. In act three, researchers may use methods including presentation decks, storytelling, and digital media. The output of these can be: presentation decks, video clips, audio clips, and pictures.

## Narrative structure from Nancy Duarte

- Beginning: Set up the current situation
- Middle: Present contrasts and possibilities
- End: Call to action and future vision
- Beginning Guidelines
    - Start by describing the status quo ("what is")
    - Make it relatable so audience recognizes their reality
    - Create contrast by introducing "what could be"
    - Use this gap to create productive tension
- Middle Section Guidelines
    - Maintain tension through alternating pattern:
    - Present "what is" (current reality)
    - Follow with "what could be" (possibility)
- Repeat this pattern multiple times
- Each contrast should build upon previous ones
- Keep emphasizing the gap between reality and possibility
- Ending Guidelines
    - Don't just list action items
    - Include an inspiring call to action
    - Describe the "new bliss" (future better state)
    - Connect to audience benefits/rewards
    - Show how change serves their needs

## Examples of Narrative Arcs

- Pixar Story Spine
    - Something changed in the product/user world, the old way no longer works, and a new solution is needed[3]
- South Park Story Spine
    - Two conflicting truths exist, creating tension that drives the story[3]
- Hero Journey: One thing that’s noteworthy in the Hero’s Journey template is where the culminating problem-solving moment happens. It’s not at the very end, as you might expect: it’s about three-quarters of the way into the journey. (Large preview)
    - The Ordinary World: Describe the current user experience
    - The Call to Adventure: Explain why change is needed
    - Challenges and Trials: Present user pain points and obstacles
    - The Transformation: Show how your recommendations can improve the user experience
    - The Return: Illustrate the potential positive outcomes of implementing changes
    - This framework can make your presentation more engaging and relatable.

## Basic Narrative Structure

- A basic arc includes the 3 c’s: context, climax, and conclusion. They become the stakes in the ground for how we will structure our research story.
- This involves creating a story with a clear beginning, middle, and end, ensuring that the narrative is easy to follow and understand.
    - Context: Set the stage with background information on the project goals and current business state[5], research goals, project background.
        - Context (Beginning)
        - Start by setting the stage for your research:
        - Explain the current state of the business or product
        - Outline the research goals and objectives
        - Provide background on why the research was conducted
        - Introduce relevant user personas or segments
        - Characters: Develop detailed user personas with backstories and motivations[1]. Develop detailed user personas with backstories and motivations
            - Give them names and brief backstories
            - Describe their goals, motivations, and frustrations
            - Use these characters to illustrate specific user experiences
            - This technique helps humanize the data and build empathy for users.
        - It’s also helpful when analyzing the research in the future and deciding how applicable it still is to current business and product needs. This is good practice when building up your knowledge network or repository.
        - Methods & Activities
        - Next, document the methods and activities used to uncover insights and why you chose them. This is helpful to build trust with stakeholders unfamiliar with the benefits of research. It’s equally useful for other researchers (and future you!) who want to know which activities yielded better insights or just want an unfiltered look into how conclusions were drawn.
    - Conflict/climax: Highlight user pain points and challenges uncovered in the research[5]
        - Good insight statements should be concise, memorable, and complete. You should avoid using words like “sometimes”, “might”, or “could”... that inject doubt. Insight statements are assertions, provocations, and should be written as “truths of the world.”
        - They should stand on their own without any explanation. Insights should also be traceable back to the themes and original source data that informed them.
        - What did you find most interesting and compelling?
        - What are the 3-5 things that you remember most?
        - What do you feel in your gut and in your intuition?
        - Present the main challenges or issues uncovered in your research:
        - Highlight key user pain points and frustrations
        - Describe obstacles preventing users from achieving their goals
        - Present contradictions between user needs and current product offerings
        - Share surprising or unexpected findings that challenge assumptions
        - This conflict creates tension and interest in your story, making stakeholders eager to learn about potential solutions.
        - Avoid dense paragraphs of text and instead rely on lots of video and audio clips, and photos taken in the field, of both the participant and their environment. If it was a remote research study, ask the participant to share photos.
        - Use verbatim quotes, and direct observations. Share moments of reflection that stand out in your mind as the research expert and ignite the viewer’s imagination. These anecdotes provide a tactile sense of experience that blends emotions with information to establish a human connection with your viewer.
        - Even small details that are seemingly unrelated are helpful to set the scene and build up empathy about the people you spent time with and learned from.
    - Resolution: Present insights and recommendations to address the identified issues[5]
        - Build up to the most important insights and findings:
        - Present key research insights that address the initial goals
        - Use data visualizations, quotes, and anecdotes to support your points
        - Highlight patterns and trends discovered in the research
        - Explain the implications of these findings for the product or business
        - The climax represents the turning point in your story, where the most crucial information is revealed.
    - Resolution (End)
        - Conclude your story by offering solutions and next steps:
        - Provide clear, actionable recommendations based on the research
        - Suggest design changes or new features to address user needs
        - Outline potential strategies to overcome identified challenges
        - Propose follow-up research or validation studies if needed
        - The resolution gives stakeholders a clear path forward and demonstrates the value of the research.
        - The end of one research project should be the beginning of another project. End your UX research report with a vision of the future, inspiring them with opportunities and recommendations to take action.
        - This section is crucial because it shows that you're thinking about the project beyond the scope of your research. It also shows that you understand the team, organizational, and business goals and objectives.
    - Reflection
        - Include a brief reflection on the research process:
        - Discuss any limitations or constraints of the study
        - Share lessons learned or unexpected outcomes
        - Suggest areas for future exploration
        - This reflection adds depth to your story and shows critical thinking about the research process.

## The end: Provide a vision of the future

- Inspire your audience by painting a picture of what success looks like:
- Describe the potential positive outcomes of implementing your recommendations
- Use before-and-after comparisons to illustrate the impact of proposed changes
- Share mock-ups or prototypes of potential solutions

## Anticipate resittance

- Anticipate resistance
- Find articles that would challenge this point of view (logical resistance)
- Proceed carefully (emotional resistance to sensitive topics)
- Practical resistance: Acqknowledge sacrifices and say you will make them too
- Share that you considered opposite points of view and that you were skeptical before too.
- Share with others and ask people to pressure that

## Facilitate change

- Facilitate change
- What is inside both me and them
- What are shared experiences
- What are common goals

## A word about research actionability

- UX Research is rarely done in a vacuum, and is always trying to help gain clarity on a decision. We want to consider what decisions your team is going to make to help determine what’s most important to share (i.e., what insights make up the core of your story).
- Some examples:
- Did your learnings highlight new considerations or questions, the team wasn’t thinking about?
- Did your learnings confirm or invalidate the team’s hypothesis?
- Did your learnings give the team a clear signal on what to do next or what not to do?

## Order of the story

Once you’ve figured out the pieces of your story — central thesis, relevant insights, and what it means for your team — it’s time to thread them together. Remember that your story might not follow the same order as the research questions in your research plan — that’s ok! This is why figuring out how to convey your story becomes important. _How_ you share your findings with your team will determine their understanding and ability to act on the insights.

## Bonus Insights

You might wonder, well what about the other ‘interesting’ insights I gathered in a study. Do I just not share that? We recommend documenting these tangential insights in an appendix section, so you don’t lose the learnings while you’re deep in synthesis and so they’re available for when they potentially become relevant in the future.

## Appendix

- An appendix is a helpful way to include more detail for those who want it, while keeping the rest of the report high level.
- Here is where you can include all of the raw data from your research project, such as photos, videos, or notes. It's essential to retain raw data in an unsynthesized form if your audience wants to review it or conduct additional analysis.
- **Include secondary research:** It’s common to conduct secondary or desk research ahead of your primary research, digging into things like whitepapers, surveys, or research previously conducted. Make sure to also include those references alongside the other raw data that informed your research findings.

## Use a bank of diagrams

- Use a bank of diagrams
- Re-use your past presentations

## Make stories come to life

- Narrate the story as if you were still in the moment

## How to plan for Questions and Answers

- Always leave time for Q and A
- When to have time or not for Q&A?
    - If you make a series of points: authorize to ask questions at each step.
    - If you are making a burning point: Authorize the questions only at the end, in order to not be interrupted.
- Anticipate questions: Prepare and rehearse
- If you do not know the answer. Admit you do not know and say you will be back with the answer
- Repeat questions that have been asked

## Attitude

- Attitude
- Deliver the presentation Standing
- Be well-lit
- Make sure your voice is clear
- Make sure the slides are easy to read
- Keep graphics simple and clean

## How to make it interactive

- Break content into small bites
- Change content every 20 seconds

- Ask questions that participants can answer in the chat
- Observe people behavior, what they are commenting
- Ask for people input before completing a message
- Send a survey at the end of the presentation

## Prepare for the presentation

- Use or be a facilitator
- Send the slides beforehand
- Send the agenda
- Send a survey
- Prep
- Have slides ready in a handy location
- Test your slides
- Provide clear instructions

## After the presentation

- Deliver reports with information relevant to stakeholders
- Ask for constant feedback after presentations

# Storytelling Format

## Best Practices for UX Research

- Limit to 3-4 major insights[1]
- Aim for a 20-30 minute presentation[1]
- Use visuals, quotes, and anecdotes to bring research to life[2][3]
- Consider interactive elements or questions to engage stakeholders[2]
- Know your audience: Tailor the story and its components to the specific stakeholders you're presenting to[3]
- Optimize for your audience Tailor your storytelling approach to your specific audience:
- Consider their background, priorities, and time constraints
- Provide an executive summary for time-crunched stakeholders
- Include an appendix with additional details for those who want to dig deeper
- Use visuals effectively: Incorporate photos, video clips, and audio to bring the research to life and create empathy[5]
- Include photos, video clips, and audio to bring the research to life
- Enhance your storytelling with visual components:
- Use photos and videos from research sessions
- Create data visualizations to illustrate key findings
- Incorporate illustrations or diagrams to explain complex concepts
- Include verbatim quotes: Use direct participant quotes to add authenticity and emotional impact[5]
- Share anecdotes and direct observations from your research
- Use verbatim quotes to bring user voices into the presentation
- Balance qualitative and quantitative data: Combine compelling anecdotes with relevant metrics to support your findings[4]
- Connect to larger narratives: Ensure your story supports broader product strategies or company missions[3]
- Connect to Business Value
- Demonstrate how your findings and recommendations align with business objectives:
- Explain how implementing changes can impact key metrics or KPIs
- Highlight potential cost savings or revenue opportunities
- Show how addressing user needs can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty
- Focus on key insights: Don't overwhelm with too much detail; prioritize the most important findings[4]
- Provide clear next steps: Conclude with actionable recommendations based on the research[4]

## Use visual elements

- Multimedia elements such as video, audio, and interactive graphics can significantly enhance the storytelling experience in UX design.
- For example, using video clips from user interviews can provide a more vivid and relatable depiction of user experiences (Teacup Lab).
- Create user journey maps to visualize the user's experience
- Use before-and-after comparisons to illustrate potential improvements
- Include photos or video clips from research sessions to bring user stories to life
- Visual storytelling can make your findings more memorable and impactful.

## Make use of breadcrumbs

- This is all about situating your audience in the content. The best way to do this is to give people a sense of the contents of your report upfront. Orienting people not only gives them context on what you’ll cover today vs. not, but also makes it easier for them to find information if they revisit your report. Examples: table of contents slide, upfront slides with key takeaways you dive into one by one, or chapters if you intend to cover multiple topics.
- This helps with wayfinding for your audience, guiding them through each section, and how they fit into the broader story. For this to be effective, it is important to pick one system of bread crumbs, and be consistent throughout the report. Examples: using a framework like journey mapping to dive into each phase or step, icons as markers for different topics, or even colors to distinguish between sections.

## Make the report scannable

- This is about ensuring you’re paying attention to the visual hierarchy of your slides as well as the flow of your content. Ways to test this:
- **Content hierarchy:** A squint test helps you determine what content is most visible on a slide and if it matches what you want your audience to focus on. If nothing jumps out, you likely have too much content or not enough hierarchy. If the wrong things jump out, reevaluate the hierarchy and layout. Remember, people naturally read top to bottom, left to right.
- **Slide flow:** To ensure the story flows well from one slide to the next, look at your deck using the grid view feature, and only read the headlines of your slides. This will tell you if the slides are in the right order and if your headlines can be written in a more succinct, or actionable way.

## Craft compelling insights

- Craft concise, memorable insight statements that avoid ambiguous language
- Use comparisons to highlight challenges and opportunities (e.g. current state vs. desired future state)
- Connect insights to larger business goals or product strategies
- Filter out interesting but non-essential information
- Clearly connect insights to potential actions or design changes
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations based on your findings
- Avoid ambiguous language like "sometimes" or "might"
- Ensure insights can be traced back to original data sources
- Connect insights to larger business goals or product strategies
- Don't stop at surface-level observations
    - Include consequences of identified issues
- Quantify impact when possible (e.g., revenue loss)
- Structure insights in three parts:
    - Problem identification
    - Immediate consequence
    - xBroader business impact

## Use quote

- Include Quotes and Anecdotes
- Incorporate direct quotes and anecdotes from your research:
- Use verbatim quotes to support key points
- Share brief stories or experiences from your research sessions
- These elements add authenticity and emotional impact to your presentation.

## Use data

- Enhancing credibility: Incorporating data into storytelling can enhance the credibility and impact of UX narratives. By using data to support the story, designers can provide a more comprehensive view of the user experience.
- This involves integrating quantitative data, such as user metrics, with qualitative insights, like user anecdotes, to create a balanced narrative.
- For instance, using verbatim quotes and direct observations from user research can add depth to the story, making it more relatable and actionable (Notably AI).

## Use Interactive Techniques

- Developing Interactive Storytelling Techniques
- Examples: The books we used in which we could control the outcome of the story.
- Examples in the past in which I used active storytelling in my presentation by using polls
- Interactive storytelling in UX design involves creating narratives that users can actively participate in. This can be achieved through interactive elements such as clickable prototypes, gamified experiences, or personalized content. By allowing users to influence the story, designers can create a more engaging and personalized experience.

## Use Analogies and Metaphors

- Use Analogies and Metaphors
- Employ analogies or metaphors to explain complex concepts:
- Compare user experiences to familiar situations
- Use metaphors to describe the current state and desired future state
- This technique can help stakeholders better understand and relate to your findings.

## Deliver action items

- Provide clear, specific recommendations based on insights[1][3]
- Connect insights to larger business goals or product strategies[3]
- Include a brief "To-do list" of next steps[2]
- Suggest design changes or new features to address user needs
- Outline potential strategies to overcome identified challenges
- Prioritize recommendations based on impact and feasibility

## Be transparent about limitations

- Be Transparent About Limitations
- Acknowledge the scope and constraints of your research:
- Discuss any limitations or shortcomings of the study[1]
- Explain what the research does and doesn't show[3]
- Suggest areas for future exploration if needed[1]

## Provide access to more information

- Provide Access to Additional Information
- Allow stakeholders to dig deeper if desired:
- Create a searchable repository of research data and artifacts[1][2]
- Include an appendix with additional details[1]
- Share the full research report for those who want more information[2]

# Storing Insights

In addition to a final presentation, we recommend for those using the research to make day-to-day decisions that you introduce a specialized research tool that democratizes the research data and insights so that they can be searchable, referenceable, and traceable back to the original source data. It’s important to close the gap between those who did the research and those using it, and tools designed for research make that easier than a powerpoint.
