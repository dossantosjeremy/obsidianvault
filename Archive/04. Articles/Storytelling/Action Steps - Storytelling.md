[[Storytelling]]

## Preparation
- [ ] Prepare by having clarity on the research objectives
- [ ] Start with the content in mind
- [ ] Use sticky notes, storyboard one idea per slide
- [ ] Sketch ideas
	- [ ] What do you want to say
	- [ ] How do you want to say it 
- [ ] Determine your goal for storytelling
	- [ ] Verify if storytelling is appropriate for your specific situation
	- [ ] Not every report or deliverable needs to be story

## Making it resonate
- [ ] Base stories on comprehensive and diverse data sets
- [ ] Make sure the story is aligned with research objectives

## Presentation division
- Quick Summary of the learnings and presentation
    - Expectations agenda: Give timings and content
- Executives: 10% of the slides divided the following way:
    - High level findings
    - Recommendations
    - Conclusions
- Changes to make on the stakeholders' mind
    - Change beliefs with facts
    - Change emotions with emotional messages
    - Change behavior with recommendations
- Order of the story
	- It does not need to follow the order of the research questions

## Think about the audience 
* Who is the audience
* Why it should matter to them
* Why are they here
* Who are they
* Why is it important
* Segment the audience
	* Politics
	* Demographics
	* Psychographics
	* Firmographics

## Storytelling techniques
* Use of storyboard
* Visually map out user interactions and key moments
* Use of video and audio clips
* Use a narrative arc
* Make use of comparisons
	* What is vs what could be
	* Current state vs future state

## Story arcs
- [ ] Use an answer first type of arc
- [ ] Then provide evidence
- [ ] All arcs have in common a beginning, middle and end 

### Examples of story arcs
* Pixar Story Spine: Something changed in the product/user world, the old way no longer works, and a new solution is needed[3]*
*  South Park Story Spine: Two conflicting truths exist, creating tension that drives the story[3]
* Hero Journey
	* - The Ordinary World: Describe the current user experience
    - The Call to Adventure: Explain why change is needed
    - Challenges and Trials: Present user pain points and obstacles
    - The Transformation: Show how your recommendations can improve the user experience
    - The Return: Illustrate the potential positive outcomes of implementing changes
    - This framework can make your presentation more engaging and relatable.
- Basic Narrative Structure: Context, Climax, Conclusion

### Act one - Setup
* User background, problems, challenges users have
* Meeting the users and their problems
	* Here we can include some output from desk research
	* Outputs: Personas, Empathy maps, user journeys... 
* According to Nancy Duarte: Setting up the current situation
* Introducing what is
* Create contrast by introducing what could be
* Create productive tension
* Context: Set the stage with background information on the project goals and current business state[5], research goals, project background.
        - Context (Beginning)
        - Start by setting the stage for your research:
        - Explain the current state of the business or product
        - Outline the research goals and objectives
        - Provide background on why the research was conducted
        - Introduce relevant user personas or segments
        - Characters: Develop detailed user personas with backstories and motivations[1]. Develop detailed user personas with backstories and motivations
            - Give them names and brief backstories
            - Describe their goals, motivations, and frustrations
            - Use these characters to illustrate specific user experiences
            - This technique helps humanize the data and build empathy for users.
        - It’s also helpful when analyzing the research in the future and deciding how applicable it still is to current business and product needs. This is good practice when building up your knowledge network or repository.
        - Methods & Activities
        - Next, document the methods and activities used to uncover insights and why you chose them. This is helpful to build trust with stakeholders unfamiliar with the benefits of research. It’s equally useful for other researchers (and future you!) who want to know which activities yielded better insights or just want an unfiltered look into how conclusions were drawn.

### Act 2 - conflict
- [ ] Present contrasts and possibilities
- [ ] Digging deeper into the conflicts
- [ ] Usability tests, assessing if a potential solution will address the issues we found 
- [ ] Character development: Conflict and tension. Usability testing... 
- [ ] Maintain the tension
	- [ ] Present what is
	- [ ] Follow with what could be
- [ ] Conflict/climax: Highlight user pain points and challenges uncovered in the research[5]
        - Good insight statements should be concise, memorable, and complete. You should avoid using words like “sometimes”, “might”, or “could”... that inject doubt. Insight statements are assertions, provocations, and should be written as “truths of the world.”
        - They should stand on their own without any explanation. Insights should also be traceable back to the themes and original source data that informed them.
        - What did you find most interesting and compelling?
        - What are the 3-5 things that you remember most?
        - What do you feel in your gut and in your intuition?
        - Present the main challenges or issues uncovered in your research:
        - Highlight key user pain points and frustrations
        - Describe obstacles preventing users from achieving their goals
        - Present contradictions between user needs and current product offerings
        - Share surprising or unexpected findings that challenge assumptions
        - This conflict creates tension and interest in your story, making stakeholders eager to learn about potential solutions.
        - Avoid dense paragraphs of text and instead rely on lots of video and audio clips, and photos taken in the field, of both the participant and their environment. If it was a remote research study, ask the participant to share photos.
        - Use verbatim quotes, and direct observations. Share moments of reflection that stand out in your mind as the research expert and ignite the viewer’s imagination. These anecdotes provide a tactile sense of experience that blends emotions with information to establish a human connection with your viewer.
        - Even small details that are seemingly unrelated are helpful to set the scene and build up empathy about the people you spent time with and learned from.
### Act 3 - Resolution
* Character triumphs
* Presentation decks
* Storytelling and digital media*
* Call to action and future vision
* List an inspiring call to action
* Describe the new bliss
* Resolution: Present insights and recommendations to address the identified issues[5]
        - Build up to the most important insights and findings:
        - Present key research insights that address the initial goals
        - Use data visualizations, quotes, and anecdotes to support your points
        - Highlight patterns and trends discovered in the research
        - Explain the implications of these findings for the product or business
        - The climax represents the turning point in your story, where the most crucial information is revealed.

### Resolution (End)
- Conclude your story by offering solutions and next steps:
- Provide clear, actionable recommendations based on the research
- Suggest design changes or new features to address user needs
- Outline potential strategies to overcome identified challenges
- Propose follow-up research or validation studies if needed
- The resolution gives stakeholders a clear path forward and demonstrates the value of the research.
- The end of one research project should be the beginning of another project. End your UX research report with a vision of the future, inspiring them with opportunities and recommendations to take action.
- This section is crucial because it shows that you're thinking about the project beyond the scope of your research. It also shows that you understand the team, organizational, and business goals and objectives.
- - Provide clear, specific recommendations based on insights[1][3]
- Connect insights to larger business goals or product strategies[3]
- Include a brief "To-do list" of next steps[2]
- Suggest design changes or new features to address user needs
- Outline potential strategies to overcome identified challenges
- Prioritize recommendations based on impact and feasibility


### Reflection
- Include a brief reflection on the research process:
- Discuss any limitations or constraints of the study
	-  Acknowledge the scope and constraints of your research:
	- Discuss any limitations or shortcomings of the study[1]
	- Explain what the research does and doesn't show[3]
	- Suggest areas for future exploration if needed[1]
	- Share lessons learned or unexpected outcomes
	- Suggest areas for future exploration
- This reflection adds depth to your story and shows critical thinking about the research process.
- - Inspire your audience by painting a picture of what success looks like:
- Describe the potential positive outcomes of implementing your recommendations
- Use before-and-after comparisons to illustrate the impact of proposed changes
- Share mock-ups or prototypes of potential solutions

## Provide access to more information
- Provide Access to Additional Information
- Allow stakeholders to dig deeper if desired:
- Create a searchable repository of research data and artifacts[1][2]
- Include an appendix with additional details[1]
- Share the full research report for those who want more information[2]


## Having in mind the research intent
- [ ] Why did we do this study
- [ ] What do we want to accomplish based on this study

## Storytelling tips
- [ ] Use diagrams as much as possible
- [ ] Use big text if this is not possible
- [ ] Use one idea per slide

## Prepare a message to elicit change
- [ ] You ___ (verb, emotion), until you ____


## Anticipate resistance
- Anticipate resistance
- Find articles that would challenge this point of view (logical resistance)
- Proceed carefully (emotional resistance to sensitive topics)
- Practical resistance: Acqknowledge sacrifices and say you will make them too
- Share that you considered opposite points of view and that you were skeptical before too.
- Share with others and ask people to pressure that

## How to plan for Questions and Answers
- Always leave time for Q and A
- When to have time or not for Q&A?
    - If you make a series of points: authorize to ask questions at each step.
    - If you are making a burning point: Authorize the questions only at the end, in order to not be interrupted.
- Anticipate questions: Prepare and rehearse
- If you do not know the answer. Admit you do not know and say you will be back with the answer
- Repeat questions that have been asked

## Bonus insights
* Place them in an appendix section

## Appendix section
* Here is where you can include all of the raw data from your research project, such as photos, videos, or notes. It's essential to retain raw data in an unsynthesized form if your audience wants to review it or conduct additional analysis.
* **Include secondary research:** It’s common to conduct secondary or desk research ahead of your primary research, digging into things like whitepapers, surveys, or research previously conducted. Make sure to also include those references alongside the other raw data that informed your research findings.

# Storytelling Formats
## Use visual elements
- Use a bank of diagrams
- Re-use your past presentations
- Multimedia elements such as video, audio, and interactive graphics can significantly enhance the storytelling experience in UX design.
- For example, using video clips from user interviews can provide a more vivid and relatable depiction of user experiences (Teacup Lab).
- Create user journey maps to visualize the user's experience
- Use before-and-after comparisons to illustrate potential improvements
- Include photos or video clips from research sessions to bring user stories to life
- Visual storytelling can make your findings more memorable and impactful.
- Make use of breadcrumbs: 
	- This is all about situating your audience in the content. The best way to do this is to give people a sense of the contents of your report upfront. Orienting people not only gives them context on what you’ll cover today vs. not, but also makes it easier for them to find information if they revisit your report. Examples: table of contents slide, upfront slides with key takeaways you dive into one by one, or chapters if you intend to cover multiple topics.
	- This helps with wayfinding for your audience, guiding them through each section, and how they fit into the broader story. For this to be effective, it is important to pick one system of bread crumbs, and be consistent throughout the report. Examples: using a framework like journey mapping to dive into each phase or step, icons as markers for different topics, or even colors to distinguish between sections.

## Make the report scannable

- This is about ensuring you’re paying attention to the visual hierarchy of your slides as well as the flow of your content. Ways to test this:
- **Content hierarchy:** A squint test helps you determine what content is most visible on a slide and if it matches what you want your audience to focus on. If nothing jumps out, you likely have too much content or not enough hierarchy. If the wrong things jump out, reevaluate the hierarchy and layout. Remember, people naturally read top to bottom, left to right.
- **Slide flow:** To ensure the story flows well from one slide to the next, look at your deck using the grid view feature, and only read the headlines of your slides. This will tell you if the slides are in the right order and if your headlines can be written in a more succinct, or actionable way.

## Make content relatable and interactive
- Use video clips of actual user experiences
- Have team members roleplay user scenarios
- Show real user struggles and experiences
- Make presentations interactive when possible
- Focus on actionable insights
- Connect insights to concrete business metrics
- - Break content into small bites
- Change content every 20 seconds
- Make presentation interactive
- Ask questions that participants can answer in the chat
- Observe people behavior, what they are commenting
- Ask for people input before completing a message
- Send a survey at the end of the presentation
- Examples: The books we used in which we could control the outcome of the story.
- Examples in the past in which I used active storytelling in my presentation by using polls
- Interactive storytelling in UX design involves creating narratives that users can actively participate in. This can be achieved through interactive elements such as clickable prototypes, gamified experiences, or personalized content. By allowing users to influence the story, designers can create a more engaging and personalized experience.

## UX Research Best Practices
- Limit to 3-4 major insights[1]
- Aim for a 20-30 minute presentation[1]
- Use visuals, quotes, and anecdotes to bring research to life[2][3]
	- - Include Quotes and Anecdotes
	- Incorporate direct quotes and anecdotes from your research:
	- Use verbatim quotes to support key points
	- Share brief stories or experiences from your research sessions
	- These elements add authenticity and emotional impact to your presentation.
- Consider interactive elements or questions to engage stakeholders[2]
- Know your audience: Tailor the story and its components to the specific stakeholders you're presenting to[3]
- - Use visuals effectively: Incorporate photos, video clips, and audio to bring the research to life and create empathy[5]
- - Create data visualizations to illustrate key findings
- Incorporate illustrations or diagrams to explain complex concepts
- Include verbatim quotes: Use direct participant quotes to add authenticity and emotional impact[5]
- - Connect to larger narratives: Ensure your story supports broader product strategies or company missions[3]
- Connect to Business Value
- - Show how addressing user needs can improve customer satisfaction and loyalty
- Focus on key insights: Don't overwhelm with too much detail; prioritize the most important findings[4]
- Provide clear next steps: Conclude with actionable recommendations based on the research[4]
- Use data
	- - This involves integrating quantitative data, such as user metrics, with qualitative insights, like user anecdotes, to create a balanced narrative.
	- For instance, using verbatim quotes and direct observations from user research can add depth to the story, making it more relatable and actionable (Notably AI).
