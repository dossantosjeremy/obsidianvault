## Define Your Niche
* Start by identifying your unique strengths, passions, and areas of expertise within UX research[](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-build-your-personal-brand-ux-researcher-xiiif). This will help you differentiate yourself and attract relevant opportunities. Consider:
	* Specific research methodologies you excel in
	* Industries or product types you're most interested in
	* Particular user groups you enjoy working with

Once you've defined your niche, ensure your website clearly communicates this specialization.

## Showcase Your Work

Your website should serve as a comprehensive portfolio of your UX research projects[](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-build-your-personal-brand-ux-researcher-xiiif)[](https://aspira.design/ux-design-fundamental/building-your-personal-brand-as-a-ux-designer/). Include:

- Case studies highlighting your research process and impact
- Quantifiable results demonstrating the value of your work
- Presentations or workshops you've conducted

When presenting your work, focus on showcasing the **impact** rather than just the process[](https://www.linkedin.com/advice/0/how-can-you-build-your-personal-brand-ux-researcher-xiiif). Include metrics such as:

- Number of research projects conducted
- Teams impacted (e.g., Product, Design, Sales)
- Cost savings or additional revenue generated
