*It can be challenging to analyze large quantities of qualitative data. This is an area in which AI can offer real value as it can use our actual research observations rather than just intelligent conjecture.* 

In this video, AI Product Designer Ioana Teleanu uses ChatGPT to analyze the results of an interview. The same approach can be used with real research data—arguably to better effect.

1.  00:00:00 --> 00:00:31
    
    As you might have experienced yourself, when  you conduct user research, you can end up with   a lot of data, and analyzing all that data can be extremely time-consuming and sometimes feel very tedious. That's where AI can help us save time  and mental energy. By letting a tool process large datasets, we can focus our energy on interpreting the results and arriving at insights instead.
    
2.  00:00:31 --> 00:01:01
    
    Research and collaboration tools are adding capabilities for processing data in multiple ways, from clustering insights and identifying themes to performing sentiment analysis and more. To overcome or reduce some of  the limitations that researching with the help of AI has, it will help to have clear goals and efficient scoping when it comes to what you want to learn from research. Also, data triangulation and generally cross-referencing insights with other data sources is important,
    
3.  00:01:01 --> 00:01:33
    
    especially when part of your data is AI-generated. You can generate multiple interviews with the help of AI and ideally multiple interviews with real people. You'll end up with a lot of data, and that's where the hard part comes in. How do you process all that data? Let's see how we can leverage the power  of AI tools for data processing and analysis. For now, we're going to use the one interview that GPT generated for us and try to analyze and unpack it with the help of GPT.
    
4.  00:01:33 --> 00:02:00
    
    It could be as simple as asking GPT, "What are the main insights from this interview? What are the main problems that Taylor is facing?" Let's see what GPT has to say. As you can see, while they're still generating,  some of them feel pretty, pretty legitimate, while others feel a bit off. Always use critical thinking to navigate the content that AI is generating.
    
5.  00:02:00 --> 00:02:30
    
    In the real world in a collaboration exercise,  now would be a good moment to discuss and unpack these findings and insights, and proceed to  prioritizing them using collaborative methods such as dot voting. Or, even better, you might want to continue to leverage the power of AI by adding them to a Miro board and then have them clustered by thematic analysis, sentiment analysis, to understand what these insights are trying to tell you.
    
6.  00:02:30 --> 00:03:01
    
    We've done just one interview, but when you have multiple interviews the insights will be further more interesting and reliable; even more so if you have real interviews as well as fictional ones. But since we're not prioritizing within a team here and we're looking to see how far we can get with the help of AI, let's see how GPT would prioritize these problems and insights. It can be as simple as asking GPT, "Can you prioritize these in the order of importance and how how often they were mentioned?"
    
7.  00:03:01 --> 00:03:32
    
    As you can see, this was probably not the most interesting prompt to use as, because we have just one interview, it's  pretty much the same structure. But if you have multiple interviews, these results will be very interesting. So, I want to encourage you to use the data-processing power of tools like GPT to prioritize insights and understand how often they were mentioned in the interviews and research data that you have available.

## AI Tools for Data Processing

1.  **[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/)**: Offers data visualization and business intelligence tools with built-in AI features for data analysis.
    
2.  **[Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/)**: Has the ability to sort through data and visualize it to search for insights.
    
3.  **[H2O.ai](https://h2o.ai/)**: Provides an open-source AI platform for machine learning and AI-driven data analysis.
    
4.  **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: As seen in the video, you can use ChatGPT to extract insights from your research.
    

## The Take Away

Managing and analyzing large datasets can be time-consuming and tedious. AI tools can help you to process data and allow you to focus on interpreting results and deriving insights. Research and collaboration tools are evolving to overcome the limitations of AI-powered research. To make the most of these tools, it's essential to set clear research goals and scope effectively.

Data triangulation and cross-referencing insights with other data sources, including AI-generated data, are critical. AI tools can help prioritize insights, especially when you have multiple datasets, interviews, and so on. As with all AI tools and insights, critical thinking is required to interpret their content and results and to collaborate effectively with a team to make the most of the insights. A collaborative approach also has the benefit of combining multiple disciplines to solve problems, which is a basic principle of user-centered design. AI can contribute to the data analysis process but shouldn't replace it.
