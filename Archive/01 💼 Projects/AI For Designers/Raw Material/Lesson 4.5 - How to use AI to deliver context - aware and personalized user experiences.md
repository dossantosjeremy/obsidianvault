*You’re likely already used to recommendations in different applications, from shopping to music and movies. But there’s more to personalization than just product recommendations. AI Product Designer Ioana Teleanu explains how AI can help you deliver personalization and explores to what extent you can implement it.*

1.  00:00:00 --> 00:00:32
    
    We could call this 'personalization', and some even prefer calling it 'hyper-personalization'.   And it's the future of products. One way I like to think about this, and to some, still non-spectacular extent, it's already happening; in the future everyone will see their own version of the internet. So, what would a hyper-personalized product look like?
    
2.  00:00:32 --> 00:01:04
    
    Well, like you want it to: part scary, part fabulous. We'll end up with our own version of products, and that's essentially a more customized and relevant experience. Context-aware AI interfaces will essentially understand who you are, where you are, what you're trying to achieve, what's your specific goal at that moment, and then adapt to give you a unique experience. So, you can imagine a product that learns your UI preferences, adapts dynamically to suit your taste
    
3.  00:01:04 --> 00:01:32
    
    and then adds a context-aware layer that understands that you're in search mode. So, the elements on the page shift to accommodate your particular goal at that particular moment. Then in the next moment, you enter a read mode and then it shifts again, persisting the layer of personalization to promote a different user goal, that of reading. Some thinkers take this exercise further with concepts such as ephemeral applications
    
4.  00:01:32 --> 00:02:00
    
    or just-in-time applications. You can imagine an environment where querying something like GPT would invoke a new application built on the spot that might only exist for the few moments that you need it in order to solve a problem. AI can be a useful engine to invoke lots of small moments that need to be packaged up in apps that have sufficient economy around them, that we're willing to invest and publish them.
    
5.  00:02:00 --> 00:02:10
    
    But with the help of AI, we can orchestrate much more interesting moments, experiences and very specific use cases.

## Applications and Examples of Context-Aware AI Experiences

1.  **Adaptive Content:** Using AI, a product can deliver custom content that is tailored for the individual. This type of content can be used for marketing products, but more importantly, has big potential for education.
    
    Sesame Workshop piloted an AI-powered Vocabulary Learning App with a class of kindergarteners. The application used games and videos featuring characters from the Sesame Street television program to teach vocabulary. The AI in the application gauged the students’ comprehension skills and tailored learning materials for them. The pilot showed promising results, with some students retaining words that are traditionally considered difficult.
    
    Such tailored learning applications can help make learning more inclusive, where students across the spectrum of cognitive abilities learn together in the same classroom.
    
2.  **Personalized Recommendations:** Digital streaming applications like Spotify and Netflix use AI to personalize song and movie recommendations. Amazon’s product recommendations are another example of AI in action. Recommendations can extend to any service that depends on individual-specific needs. Here are some examples:
    
    1.  Itineraries and hotel recommendations for a vacation.
        
    2.  Fashion/style recommendations based on individual tastes and preferences.
        
    3.  A personalized magazine that curates content tailored to an individual’s interests.
        
    4.  Meal plans and exercise regimes tailored according to specific health conditions. 
        
3.  **Adaptive User Interfaces:** Complex applications that offer several features can overwhelm users. In such cases, the application might learn from user behavior to only offer features that are most relevant to the user.
    
    Siemens promises such adaptive UIs in its NX software. NX is a computer-aided design software that designers and engineers use to create 2D and 3D models. CAD software is often used in architecture and manufacturing industries and offers complex functionalities for different user types. Siemens’ NX learns from a user’s behavior and context to predict which commands the user might perform and offers those shortcuts in the context of their usage. The company also claims that the software learns the expert users’ behaviors to help develop onboarding programs.

In complex softwares where there may be hundreds of possible actions, an adaptive interface can streamline workflows by personalizing interfaces to suit individual patterns and behavior.

## How to Address Concerns Around Hyper-Personalization

1.  **Privacy:** Since AI learns from user data, privacy is one of the biggest concerns of personalization. Here, transparency is your friend. Always seek consent before gathering data and make it explicitly clear what types of data you intend to collect, how you plan to use them and the steps you take to secure that data. Provide an easy way for users to be able to delete their personal data.
    
2.  **Bias:** Social media applications are among the biggest casualties (or perhaps instigators) of algorithm-perpetuated bias. When people are not exposed to different viewpoints, they can become extremely intolerant of opposing thoughts. To mitigate this risk, ensure the training data is as inclusive as possible. This may be difficult to control if the training data is crowdsourced. In such cases, see if you can build a content-moderation or -reviewing mechanism. In all cases, continually evaluate your product’s algorithm and refine it to ensure it is as unbiased as possible.
    
3.  **Fatigue:** Constantly being bombarded by similar content can be monotonous. People’s preferences evolve over time, and an AI trained on past human behavior won’t be able to predict if and when people want something new. To work around this, you can build features into your product that allow users to reset the algorithm or control the extent of personalization. For example, a music streaming app might suggest a random song that doesn’t match the user’s profile at all to introduce them to something different.
    

## The Take Away

From a school curriculum that is tailored to match their learning speed and style to an exercise regimen that factors their unique health conditions and goals, AI offers the potential to build a world that’s tailored just for a single user. 

While personalization offers a glimpse of a utopian world, it is far from perfect. It can lead to user fatigue and perpetuate biases. Continuously practice sound user-centered design—research, prototype, test and iterate—to mitigate problems and ensure your product succeeds.
