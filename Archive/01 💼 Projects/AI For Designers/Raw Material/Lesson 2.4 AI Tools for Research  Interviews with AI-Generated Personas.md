*Generative AIs such as ChatGPT have assimilated a huge body of knowledge from the internet. They can provide some interesting food for thought while you try to imagine what your solutions might look like and some general characteristics of likely users.*

In this video, AI product Designer, Ioana Teleanu, simulates an interview with an AI-generated persona.

1.  00:00:00 --> 00:00:30
    
    One of the ways in which we can use AI  tools is to simulate a conversation with a persona. Now, this is very controversial and you will almost certainly get very stereotypical and generic data, but you can use these as a starting point to map out the main themes. And always talk to real users to  challenge and validate your initial research.
    
2.  00:00:30 --> 00:01:04
    
    Hopefully, research tools will advance  to accept real past research, and then   use it to construct more relevant realistic  and meaningful insights. Until then, with the right mindset and a deep awareness of the dangers and limitations, you can still spot ideas worth investigating further based on a fictional conversation with an AI. Using the persona generated by GPT, we're going to try to imagine a fictional conversation with it.  For that, we're going to ask GPT to generate an interview script and then the actual interview.
    
3.  00:01:04 --> 00:01:34
    
    Let's see how that goes. To generate the  interview script, I'm simply going to ask GPT: "Can you give me an interview script for an interview unpacking productivity problems with Taylor?" As you can see, it's doing a pretty decent job. But make sure to always keep in mind that \*you can never replace real users from the process\* and that interviews with GPT will only give you \*very stereotypical data and mostly generic\*.
    
4.  00:01:34 --> 00:02:03
    
    This is a pretty decent interview script; let's see how the conversation might play out. "Can you turn this interview script into an actual conversation with Taylor?" Let's see how this imaginary conversation would look. These fictional interviews are  mostly based on demographical data,   statistical interpretations, and so on, so  they can't possibly capture the nuances  
    
5.  00:02:03 --> 00:02:33
    
    and details that an interview with a real  person would. That's why at all times it's important to include real people in the process and maybe just complement the real data from interviews with AI-generated data. Before moving into the next stage, I want to restate the importance and value of talking to real people in the process. AI-generated insights can never replace human conversations. And they shouldn't. Think of them as pointers or just interesting directions
    
6.  00:02:33 --> 00:02:37
    
    you might want to dive deeper into – and hopefully in reality.

## AI Tools for Personas

1.  **[The AI Toolbox for Innovators](https://ai.boardofinnovation.com/)**: There’s a free tool that can generate personas.
    
2.  **[DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)**: Can generate images for your personas.
    
3.  **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: As Ioana did, you can generate personas with ChatGPT.
    
4.  **[Poll the People](https://pollthepeople.app/)**: Allows you to conduct consumer research with over 500,000 human panelists. It then uses ChatGPT-powered AI to analyze survey responses, quickly extracting key insights
    
5.  **[User Persona](https://userpersona.dev/)**: Lets you enter a description of your product or service and generates a user persona for you.
    

## The Take Away

We can simulate conversations with personas with the help of AI tools. Use AI-generated insights as a starting point to identify main themes, but be aware that AI is likely to employ potentially generic data. Similarly, AI "interviews" are based on broad assumptions and provide only a superficial understanding of the problem domain, which makes them an unsuitable replacement for qualitative research with real users. To ensure accuracy, validate the insights and engage in your own user research—AI can’t replace the real thing. 

AI should be considered as a preliminary guide rather than a substitute for genuine human interaction and a deep understanding of user needs and behaviors.
