Welcome to your first portfolio exercise*.* We hope you’re excited to get started! The work you do in the exercise is a great way to put what you’ve learned into practice. It can also provide material for your portfolio—to showcase your quantitative research abilities.

The portfolio project will be built up over several topics in the lessons. We’re not going to ask you to spend a long time on it, and whether you do it at all is entirely up to you. You might like to try out the activities and come back to them at a later stage when you have more time. If you do undertake the project, we encourage you to share your experiences in the discussion forum mentioned at the end of each exercise.

You’re going to build on this project as you go, so try to save the session of the AI tool, or tools, you use. 

The goal of this exercise is to practice and demonstrate your understanding of AI tools in UX research:

1.  Choose a problem domain that you have some knowledge of.
    
2.  Identify a fairly narrow question in that domain.
    
3.  Ask the question of one or more AI tools.
    
4.  Use critical thinking to evaluate the answers (this is where your existing domain knowledge comes in).
    
5.  Use other sources to fact-check the AI answers. A web search is usually a good place to start.
    
6.  Summarize your findings for your portfolio and share with the discussion group.
    

These activities are optional. They’re an opportunity to build a portfolio to show prospective employers and to have a bit of fun!

## Activities in This Exercise

The steps described above are mostly self-explanatory, but here are some additional notes:

-   **Choose a problem domain and a question.** Because we'd like to understand how much trust to place in AI tools, it’s best to choose a problem domain in which you already have some experience. This will make it easier to assess the answers. Also, to make the task manageable, formulate a question that should have a focused answer. Avoid asking for general information or the history of a topic—you will be swamped by the answer. If you can't think of any yourself, you could try one of these (assuming that you have some knowledge of UX and usability already):
    
    -   "Who invented the term user experience?" (See references below about the answer Don Norman got when he asked this!)
        
    -   "How do Nielsen's 10 usability heuristics apply to accessibility?" (The answer we received contained a significant factual error in the first paragraph.)
        
-   **Use critical thinking and other sources to evaluate the answer.** This is where your own domain knowledge comes in. Does the AI answer to your question sound reasonable? Are there any areas that give you cause for doubt? Use other sources such as a web search to fact-check anything that causes you doubt. You can also ask your AI to provide more information and sources, but beware that just because an answer includes an author's name or date doesn't mean that the reference is real!
    

Once you have your AI's answers and have evaluated them, write up a short summary for your portfolio and share this in the discussion group below. 

Use the following templates to help craft effective prompts so you can achieve your desired—keep these handy for each time you use AI tools.

Tip: Use screenshots or photos to make your point

How do I **take a screenshot** — for easy uploading to a discussion?

**Take a Screenshot — with a PC**

-   Use the PRT SCR or PRT SC button to capture the screenshot.
-   Open Paint (or in early versions of Windows MS Paint).
-   Click CTRL + V to paste the screenshot into Paint.
-   Save the screenshot in Paint.

**Note:** You can use any art package on your PC instead of Paint if you wish. We have chosen Paint because it comes as a standard part of the operating system.

**Take a Screenshot — with a Mac**

-   Press Command + Shift + 3 to take a screenshot.
-   The screenshot is saved on the desktop as a .PNG file.

**Use the Snipping Tool — on a PC**

-   Search for ‘Snipping Tool’ inside your computer.
-   Press ‘New’ (see screenshot below).
-   Your screen will freeze and you’ll be able to select the area that you want to create an image from.
-   Once you've selected the image, select File > Save As to save what you’ve captured as an image.
