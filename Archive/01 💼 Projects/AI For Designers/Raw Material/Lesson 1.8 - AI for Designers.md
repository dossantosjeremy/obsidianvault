Engage with an AI tool of your choice, such as ChatGPT or Midjourney, that operates through prompts. First, investigate its functionalities and contemplate how it can enhance your design work processes. Choose any part of the design process, from ideation to UI design, where you think the AI tool you’ve chosen could be most helpful. Then, experiment with various types of prompts and iterate to understand their impact on the output.

Did you get what you were expecting at the first try? What prompts ended up being more useful? What advantages and hurdles did you encounter? 

Reflect on your experience and think how it could benefit your design process. What are the benefits and challenges?

Tip: Use screenshots or photos to make your point

How do I **take a screenshot** — for easy uploading to a discussion?

**Take a Screenshot — with a PC**

-   Use the PRT SCR or PRT SC button to capture the screenshot.
-   Open Paint (or in early versions of Windows MS Paint).
-   Click CTRL + V to paste the screenshot into Paint.
-   Save the screenshot in Paint.

**Note:** You can use any art package on your PC instead of Paint if you wish. We have chosen Paint because it comes as a standard part of the operating system.

**Take a Screenshot — with a Mac**

-   Press Command + Shift + 3 to take a screenshot.
-   The screenshot is saved on the desktop as a .PNG file.

**Use the Snipping Tool — on a PC**

-   Search for ‘Snipping Tool’ inside your computer.
-   Press ‘New’ (see screenshot below).
-   Your screen will freeze and you’ll be able to select the area that you want to create an image from.
-   Once you've selected the image, select File > Save As to save what you’ve captured as an image.
