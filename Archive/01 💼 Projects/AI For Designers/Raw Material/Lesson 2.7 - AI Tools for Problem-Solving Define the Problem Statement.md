*During product development, we move from user research to a definition of the problem we're trying to solve for our users. AI tools can help with this, but again, they are best suited to providing interesting insights and don’t serve as a replacement to ideation based on an understanding of real users.*

In this video, Ioana Teleanu, AI Product Designer, uses ChatGPT to generate a problem statement. The AI tool identifies and prioritizes problems brought forward from previous interactions. Next, Ioana asks ChatGPT to generate some "How Might We's" and user stories from the problem statement.

1.  00:00:00 --> 00:00:32
    
    You've explored a problem space, researched your audience and have a bunch of insights. Your next step is to translate all these insights into a problem statement we’re aiming to solve, and then consequently into a set of features and user stories. AI can help you by acting as a sounding board and a conversation partner. AI should do a pretty decent job with this,
    
2.  00:00:32 --> 00:01:00
    
    since synthesis is one of its better abilities. To help it succeed, it would be a good idea to feed it data that's already clean, interpreted and prioritized. Since the quality of the result will be mostly dependent on the quality of the input provide as many instructions as possible. Things such as the format or examples. Let's see how to exploration and analysis we've done so far would translate into a problem statement.
    
3.  00:01:00 --> 00:01:31
    
    We'll ask GPT to write us a problem statement based on the insights it generated so far. I'm going to try to be as specific as possible when asking GPT to write a problem statement, also mentioning the goal I'm looking for with this exercise. Using the problems and priorities you've listed above consolidate everything into a single problem statement that will serve as the design goal we set to solve as we continue with the UX process. Excited to see if GPT gets it.
    
4.  00:01:31 --> 00:02:03
    
    As you can see, this is a pretty good answer, but is quite long, so I will try to shorten it by instructing GPT to do that. You can very quickly ask GPT: Can you shorten this? The more concise a problem statement, the easier it is to socialize with people in your team and it's easier to grasp. Now is a good time to pause the AI generated UX
    
5.  00:02:03 --> 00:02:32
    
    design process and apply critical thinking. As you can see and feel the problem statement that GPT came up with is pretty broad and generic, so you would have to refine it a lot or even rewrite that completely. Since this is infant technology, we can't fully rely on it to give us meaningful directions in the design process. However, it's been a fun process so far and the purpose of this journey is to understand both the capabilities
    
6.  00:02:32 --> 00:03:01
    
    and opportunities as well as the limitations that AI tools possess. Now that we have the problem statement, we will explore how we can evolve it into more tangible design questions and action points by formulating how-might-we use and user stories. The prompt is pretty simple: Based on this problem statement can you generate 4 how might we’s? The how might we seem to be pretty solid. How about we design a feature that helps Taylor
    
7.  00:03:01 --> 00:03:33
    
    intelligently prioritize tasks based on deadlines and importance? How might we develop a function that effectively reduces distractions and helps Taylor maintain focus doing work periods? So tackling the distraction problem. How might we create an integrated system that allows our productivity tool to seamlessly interact with Taylor's existing apps? Integrations. And then the fourth one: How might we streamline Taylor's task management process in a way that significantly improves their workflow efficiency and work life balance? It lost a bit of context, and it went a bit off
    
8.  00:03:33 --> 00:04:04
    
    because we were trying to keep it in the individual productivity space. But these are pretty good answers for an AI-generated response. These questions formulated as how-might-we’s can serve as starting points to brainstorming solutions that address the core problems faced by Taylor. Let's see how the user stories might look like. It can be as simple as instructing GPT to transform these into user stories. Again,
    
9.  00:04:04 --> 00:04:32
    
    it seems to be doing a pretty decent job. As an interesting next step, you might also want to add these as post-its in a Miro board, which would make them easier to organize, move around, prioritize cluster by sentiment, cluster by themes and more importantly, socialize within your team and company. Remember that design is conversation and collaboration. Even if AI can serve as a partner
    
10.  00:04:32 --> 00:04:36
    
    in co-creating design, it's with real people that the magic happens.

As Ioana says, ChatGPT works as a sounding board and conversation partner, which pushes the design process forward.

## AI Tools for Problem-Solving

1.  **[IBM Watson](https://www.ibm.com/au-en/watson)**: Offers AI-driven solutions for problem-solving in healthcare, customer support, and business analytics, among other areas.
    
2.  **[Google Cloud AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai)**: Has a variety of AI tools for natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning, which can be applied to various problem-solving tasks.
    
3.  **[OpenAI's GPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: Can generate human-like text and is used for a wide range of problem-solving applications, from chatbots to content generation.
    
4.  **[The AI Toolbox for Innovators](https://ai.boardofinnovation.com/how-might-we-statement)**: For this tool, you input the target audience and the problem to generate five different “How Might We’s”.
    

## The Take Away

After conducting user research and developing personas, you need to translate insights into a clear problem statement, features, and user stories for design. AI can assist in this process in the role of conversation partner, but the quality of AI-generated results depends on the input data, which should be clean, interpreted, and prioritized. The problem statement should be specific and goal-oriented, and AI-generated statements may need refinement since they tend to be broad and generic. 

"How might We’s" are a useful way to formulate actionable design questions based on the problem statement, and user stories can be generated from these questions. AI is a valuable tool; however, real people are essential for the collaborative design process, as the magic truly happens when individuals are involved in co-creating design solutions.
