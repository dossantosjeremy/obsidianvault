*Artificial intelligence presents endless opportunities to improve our, and our users’ lives. While the underlying technologies seem to be under the control of data scientists and engineers, designers play a crucial role to bridge the gap between user needs and technology.*

In this video, AI Product Designer, Ioana Teleanu outlines the different opportunities for designers to incorporate AI in their products.

    The challenges AI poses are significant.  But AI is also presenting us with a fascinating   range of opportunities, and since I'm an  AI enthusiast, I want to explore these as well.   AI is changing the world in general, but I  like to dive deeper into exploring how it can   positively impact \*digital products\*. Some of these are personalization – tailored adaptive products;
    
2.  00:00:34 --> 00:01:02
    
    context – understanding the user's context and needs; efficiency – speed and information; a better understanding of user patterns. Notice that I say 'patterns', not 'psychology'? And testing – products can present users with multiple versions of design solutions to see which performs best. Automating stuff, like customer support, error recognition; supporting the user with their goal through generative technologies.
    
3.  00:01:02 --> 00:01:12
    
    And these are just some of the few that we are currently aware of. The future of products is rapidly transforming,  and I can't wait to see where it will take us!

Designing with AI is no different from any other design process. We begin with sound user research to understand user pain points and develop solutions to solve problems and support user tasks. AI is only an enabling tool, not the end goal. We mustn’t incorporate AI just because we can or because it makes for a great marketing campaign. AI must help solve problems or meaningfully improve the user’s experience.

## Where to Incorporate AI in Products and Solutions

### 1\. To Increase Efficiency

Consider how you can improve the speed with which a user can complete a task. AI can learn from the user’s behavior and identify patterns and offer suggestions. For example, Siri suggests shortcuts on iPhones based on the user’s actions. If you step out for a run every morning at 6 am, and turn on a pedometer app, Siri might learn this behavior and suggest opening the app at 6 am.

Google’s keyboard “Glide Typing” (where users can slide over a keyboard and type without lifting their fingers), and Voice Typing (speech-to-text) make typing efficient. The keyboard also learns frequently used words and suggests those as the user types.

To improve efficiency, consider how you can save your users’ time, resources and costs with AI-powered solutions. Route-planning tools are great examples of applications that provide great efficiencies. If a driver needs to deliver five packages across town, the AI tool could suggest the shortest route, factoring in traffic conditions and road conditions to ensure a smooth ride.

With almost every product and service available to us at our fingertips, delivery and fulfillment companies rely extensively on route-planning software to ensure their personnel follow optimized routes, which reduces time, fuel cost and driver fatigue.

### 2\. To Reduce or Eliminate Mundane Tasks

Tasks that are boring, repetitive and require very little or no judgment or decision-making are ideal to outsource to machines. From video transcriptions and meetings to managing a personal calendar and meal planning, AI has already flooded our lives to reduce the clutter of everyday tasks. 

Design tools have steadily automated mundane tasks. With generative AI, highly labor-intensive tasks such as background removal and composing complex graphics are as easy as typing a prompt. 

A short video that depicts Adobe new AI feature, Generative Fill in their application, Photoshop. It shows that by entering a prompt, certain areas of an image will change accordingly. In the example, the image starts as a library, and then the prompt 'jungle' is input. After a few more prompts, the image is completely transformed.

Adobe Photoshop’s generative fill lets you create complex graphics with a few clicks and prompts. A task that would have taken hours to achieve without the technology.

You can implement such automations for your products as well. For example, an accounting tool could generate weekly reports of revenue and profit/loss statements and email them to the appropriate stakeholders, instead of a bookkeeper doing this task manually. The tool could also flag abnormal transactions or mismatched entries to ensure the books of accounts are always balanced. 

**Automation isn’t always the best solution.** Just because a task can be automated doesn’t mean it should. For example, users may find joy in a manual task. A personal journal that’s filled by AI would defeat the entire purpose of the journal! If a user wants a creative outlet, an AI tool might suggest prompts *to* the user to spark their creativity, instead of generating the content itself.

Other situations where users would prefer doing tasks themselves include when they’re personally accountable for them, especially a high-stakes one. Consider a doctor trying to diagnose a critically ill patient. They wouldn’t want to rely solely on an AI’s recommendation, since a patient’s life—and the doctor’s reputation—is at stake. In this case, the AI might help the doctor by processing data and prompting the doctor to consider alternative possibilities that they may miss. But ultimately, the doctor would likely want a high degree of control over their work.

User research will help you uncover what users truly want, to help you decide which tasks are suitable for automation, and to what extent. Instead of defaulting to automation, start by questioning the role of automation and whether it will help improve the user experience. 

### 3\. To Support User Tasks

As a designer, your main goal is to solve problems and help users complete their tasks. Your product should be as “invisible” in the process as possible. Consider how AI’s data processing and pattern detection superpowers can support users. For example, could it forecast inventory requirements, preempt an equipment malfunction or help with customer support?

Planful, a financial planning tool, learns from the user’s past financial performance for forecasting future cash requirements. A finance manager can then apply these forecasts to her work.

AI may help your users complete tasks that were previously not possible or not easily accessible.

### 4\. To Improve Safety and Health

Through real-time data processing, AI can help keep your users safe.

Apple’s devices have built-in health and safety features. The iPhone tracks a user’s gait to determine if they are at risk of falling. If the Apple Watch detects that a user has fallen, it can help connect them to emergency services if needed.

## The Take Away

AI is a superpower that you must wield carefully. Done right, it can make your users’ lives much easier by increasing efficiency, reducing mundane tasks, helping users achieve their goals and improving their safety.

Remember that AI is not always necessary. As a designer, your goal is to solve problems and help people meet their goals. Find out what these goals and problems are through user research. Ideate holistic solutions over individual features and then consider how AI can help optimize the solutions.
