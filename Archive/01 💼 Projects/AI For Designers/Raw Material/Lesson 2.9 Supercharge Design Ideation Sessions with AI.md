# Introduction

- Product design is about people using their critical thinking and feeling skills to solve problems for other people
- That is the goal: Learning how far we can go with just AI and learning about its limitations on the way. 
- We have
	- an understanding of the market
	- the competition
	- our design questions
	- and insights about our users

# Brainstorming

## Process
* We feed Chat GPT with how might wes and user stories and we ask it to come up with corresponding ideas to address them. 
* Prompt: What are some ideas for a product (mobile application) that could address the user needs and stories?
* The initial response is pretty generic. 
* We need to use prompting-refinement techniques
	* We feed it with more context
	* We feed it with more detailed instructions
* We will give it interesting ideas and ask it to dive deeper into them, keeping the persona in mind
* We use our own critical thinking to choose the juicest ideas 
* Prompt: Could you expand more on a couple of ideas mentioned here: The focus mode and smart task prioritization?
* Next step is to put more details and clarity in it 
	* What do these features mean
	* What does it actually look like
	* It means translating all that into functionality
* We ask chat gpt to translate the ideas into features
* Prompt: Can you translate the ideas for Focus Mode into features?
* We can then ask Chat GPT to prioritize these features
* Prompt: Which of these features are the most important ones: The key features that would differentiate this product from others in the market?
* We might need to refine the answers by asking GPT to use the answers from the previous questions to create a priority list between them. 
* The key to succeeding is to be clear with the context, clear with the instructions and clear with the goal you have in mind when trying to get an output from GPT. 
* This is a trial and error process

# Going further
- Use plugins and visuals to ask GPT to generate diagrams and user flows
- Create a user flow for a productivity app with the features we discussed



# Takeaway
- Provide AI with context and detailed instructions to get meaningful results
- The relationship between AI and human creativity should be seen as a symbiotic one - we should collaborate with AI to achieve the best results.
