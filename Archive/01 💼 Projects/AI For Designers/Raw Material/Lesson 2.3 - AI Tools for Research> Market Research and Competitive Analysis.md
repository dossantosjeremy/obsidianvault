*People are important in the application of AI to research problems. We have complex skill sets and broad knowledge of the real world. Through meaningful interaction with AI tools, we can resolve complex research questions, together, more effectively than either of us can alone.* 

In this video, AI Product Designer, Ioana Teleanu, explains how AI can help us explore the problem space and competition landscape when we design products:

1.  00:00:00 --> 00:00:30
    
    AI can't really figure out what problems to solve for people just yet, but it can help us with some interesting starting points. It is us that with our systems thinking, putting to work together complex skills such as psychology, observation, critical thinking, domain knowledge, empathy, curiosity and so on; It's us who can identify real problems that people face
    
2.  00:00:30 --> 00:01:02
    
    and unpack them in a meaningful, non-stereotypical way. All the information generated by AI should be taken with a grain of salt, but if you fact check it and cross-reference it or even challenge the AI to provide information sources for the answer it provides, then it can serve as an interesting foundation for your research efforts. Let's see how we can explore the problem space using ChatGPT. You can start with a broader question that gives GPT some context,
    
3.  00:01:02 --> 00:01:31
    
    but also allows for large enough answers that you can then narrow down into the parts who are most interested about. It could be something like: I'm looking to understand the most common or interesting problems that people face when it comes to everyday productivity. What do you know about our struggles? Let's see what GPT has to say about this. As you can see, GPT gave a pretty large response,
    
4.  00:01:31 --> 00:02:01
    
    and I am going to start by narrowing down the scope of this answer. You could do that by trying a prompt like: I'm particularly interested in learning more about what causes procrastination and how distractions affect us in more detail. Can we expand on these two points? So at this point, we probably have a
    
5.  00:02:01 --> 00:02:39
    
    pretty solid body of content that we can start diving deeper into. But before we do that, I just want to mention the first limitation that we can already notice AI showcasing. Where does this information come from? I'm going to challenge it by saying something like: You've mentioned that research has shown some interesting insights. Can you point me toward some research that was done around why we procrastinate and how distractions work? But as you can see,
    
6.  00:02:39 --> 00:03:00
    
    GPT already gave us some directions and some important themes in trying to unpack the problem space of productivity. Let's see how we can move further down this road. You can continue by trying to understand a competitive space. Maybe research a little your competitors and create a rough, competitive analysis.
    
7.  00:03:00 --> 00:03:30
    
    Let's see how we might do that. You can ask GPT something like: Are there any apps that are currently helping people with the problem of distractions and procrastination? As you can see, ChatGPT is generating a lot of content on this and it's pointing it towards several products. At this point, it will actually make sense to research those products, make sure they exist, but build your own understanding
    
8.  00:03:30 --> 00:04:01
    
    of how a competitive space looks like to complement what GPT had to offer. This list feels pretty long, so I would narrow down my scope by asking ChatGPT to point me towards the one most popular productivity app. Notice that here GPT provides some context for the information it's offering, informing you that its last training was in September 2021. However, it didn't really get my question, so it's providing multiple applications again.
    
9.  00:04:01 --> 00:04:31
    
    But there is a limitation and understanding what most popular means. So the answer is pretty good. I'm going to continue narrowing down my scope and I'm going to ask GPT to tell me more about personal use of productivity apps, which is the problem space I'm most interested in. I'm going to ask it something like: These are all work productivity apps. Do you know which are the most popular personal productivity apps? Also, I would be interested in learning their strong points
    
10.  00:04:31 --> 00:05:00
    
    and weak points. As you can see by now, we have a pretty long list of productivity apps. I'm going to try to move into understanding what might be the audience for a productivity app. How would the person that I'm targeting look like? Let's try to find out how GPT would describe our ideal persona. I'm simply going to prompt it: Can you describe our ideal persona for this productivity app?
    
11.  00:05:00 --> 00:05:31
    
    Or even better. Can you imagine our ideal persona for this productivity app? Let's see how GPT would do that. Okay. So GPT imagined Taylor, our ideal persona for the productivity app we're trying to build. I think we took this exercise far enough for you to get an idea of how you might explore the problem space of a design problem you're trying to solve. Remember that the quality of information that GPT or similar tools generate is limited and questionable.
    
12.  00:05:31 --> 00:05:46
    
    I would recommend fact checking everything and being very much aware that the quality of the answers you are getting is dependent on the quality of the prompts and insisting long enough until you get the desired refined results to your questions.

As Ioana demonstrated in the example you’ve just seen, start with a broad prompt and refine as you go to get the results you want. Remember to challenge AI and fact-check to ensure the validity of the results you get. 

## AI Tools for  Market Research and Competitive Analysis

1.  **[ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)**: This generative AI language model can help with a range of different market research activities. It can give you a good sense of the problem space as Ioana showed in the video. 
    
2.  **[The AI Toolbox for Innovators](https://ai.boardofinnovation.com/)**: They have a range of free AI tools, including problem understanding, research scripts, research briefs and can generate personas. While this gives us a good idea of intended users, personas must always be based on user research.
    
3.  **[DALL-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2)**: You can generate persona images with this tool.
    
4.  **[Miro AI](https://miro.com/aq/ps/assist/)**: Instantly transforms new or complex ideas into structured models like user stories, acceptance criteria, technical diagrams, and code.
    

## The Take Away

AI tools can help you explore the problem space of design challenges—pose broad questions and then refine them for focused insights. However, AI-generated content necessitates rigorous fact-checking and critical thinking to ensure accuracy. The quality of AI responses depends on the quality of the prompts, which can be iteratively improved.

It’s essential to recognize the inherent limitations in the quality of AI-generated content and remain vigilant in refining results to extract valuable insights in your design process.
