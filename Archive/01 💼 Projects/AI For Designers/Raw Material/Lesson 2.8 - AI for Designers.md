It’s time for your next portfolio exercise*.* We hope you're keen to try out some of the ideas raised in the previous lessons.

In this exercise, you’re going to use an AI to help define a problem and its solutions:

1.  **Choose a product, problem domain and a question**. We'd like to understand how much trust to place in AI tools, it’s best to choose a product area in which you already have some experience. This will make it easier to assess the answers. As in our earlier portfolio activity, ask a question that should have a fairly narrow response. You want a few hundred words from the AI you're using, not a few thousand. 
    

For example,  "We want to create a website that would allow users to buy clothes based on their impact on the environment. What kind of features would that site need to have?" (The answer was about 240 words.)

2.  **Think about what the product needs to do and who the users are.** Outline some scenarios to understand what a user of your product might need to do to achieve the goals you have in mind. Do the AI suggestions cover them? If not, consider asking the AI to make adjustments. Alternatively, consider rephrasing your question. 
    

3.  **Tell the AI tool about your product and its users.**
    
4.  **Ask the "How Might We" questions as Ioana demonstrated in 2.7**. The AI should respond with detailed steps that should make sense. Again, consider some user scenarios to see if they do.
    
5.  **Consider the responses**. Do they look reasonable based on the information provided?
    
6.  **Ask the tool to provide sources or to adjust the responses**.
    
7.  If you can, **keep this session open for the next portfolio exercise**.
    
8.  **Summarize your findings** and **share it with the discussion group**.  For your portfolio, you might want to summarize the AI response as a list of features rather than including the complete text.
    

These activities are optional. They’re an opportunity to build a portfolio to show prospective employers and to have a bit of fun!

Tip: Use screenshots or photos to make your point

How do I **take a screenshot** — for easy uploading to a discussion?

**Take a Screenshot — with a PC**

-   Use the PRT SCR or PRT SC button to capture the screenshot.
-   Open Paint (or in early versions of Windows MS Paint).
-   Click CTRL + V to paste the screenshot into Paint.
-   Save the screenshot in Paint.

**Note:** You can use any art package on your PC instead of Paint if you wish. We have chosen Paint because it comes as a standard part of the operating system.

**Take a Screenshot — with a Mac**

-   Press Command + Shift + 3 to take a screenshot.
-   The screenshot is saved on the desktop as a .PNG file.

**Use the Snipping Tool — on a PC**

-   Search for ‘Snipping Tool’ inside your computer.
-   Press ‘New’ (see screenshot below).
-   Your screen will freeze and you’ll be able to select the area that you want to create an image from.
-   Once you've selected the image, select File > Save As to save what you’ve captured as an image.
