How much will I have to **pay for the courses**?

After you pay for your membership, you can take as many courses as you want with **no additional costs**. There are **no further charges** on top of the membership fee.

Can I take **more than one course** at a time?

With a **Professional membership** you can take as many courses as you would like, with no further charges. For example, if there are 30 active courses, you can enroll in all 30 courses at the same time and move from one to another as you prefer.  

With a **Student membership**, you can take a maximum of two courses at the same time. You can still take as many courses as you would like – free of extra charges – just as long as you finish or drop them so that you don’t have more than two ongoing courses. 

Can I get **my manager to pay** for my membership?

Yes! All you have to do is: 

1.  Get **approval from your manager** (e.g., using the email template below).
2.  [Pay with your credit card](https://www.interaction-design.org/join) (either your own or your corporate credit card).
3.  Your **invoice will be ready** **instantly** — and we can modify it to meet your manager's requirements.
4.  Our 14-day money-back guarantee protects you and your manager.

**Example email for your manager

Dear manager, 

I would like to get reimbursement for my Interaction Design Foundation membership. This membership can benefit our team and company in the following ways:

1.  I can enroll in all the IxDF’s self-paced, online courses (in my spare time), which will help me complete current projects with better results.
2.  I can network with peers from all over the world and find out how others have addressed issues we are currently facing.
3.  I will be able to continuously educate myself on UX topics through the IxDF's courses and eBooks. 
4.  Because of the breadth of educational materials, I will learn how to solve specific design problems.
5.  I want to offer to share the key takeaways from the courses with my team.

PS: To give you some background, the Interaction Design Foundation is an educational foundation comprising the world’s design and UX elite, and you can read more about the foundation at [https://www.interaction-design.org/about](https://www.interaction-design.org/about)

I missed the enrollment, and now the **course is closed**. What can I do?

Don't worry if you **missed the course**. We will re-run it shortly. One of the reasons we continually open and close courses is in order to control the classroom size.

**Networking** is a large part of our value proposition, so we want *just* the right number of people inside the courses. That is also why we display the "XX % percent booked" on our course icons.
