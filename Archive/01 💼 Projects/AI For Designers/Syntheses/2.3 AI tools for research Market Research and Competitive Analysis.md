# Need for humans

- AI cannot figure out what problems to solve for people just yet. 
- It is us who can identify problems that people face and how we can solve it
- All information generated by AI should be taken with a grain of salt. 
- There is a need to fact check, cross reference AI results with other sources

# UX Research for a productivity App

## The problem space
- How can we explore a problem space using chat gpt. 
- Using a broad question to ask chat gpt for a broad context and also providing large enough answers. 
- You can then narrow down into the parts you are the most interested about

## Example of prompt to understand better the problem space
* I'm looking to understand the most common or interesting problems that people face when it comes to everyday productivity. What do you know about our struggles?

## Narrowing down
* Example: I am particularly interested in learning more about what causes procrastination and how distrations affect us in more detail. Can you expand on these 2 points?

## First limitations of AI
* Where does this information come from?

## Challenge AI
- Ask it to point us towards research that was conducted on this topic. 

## Continue by trying to understand the competitive space
* Create a rough competitive analysis
* Prompt: Are there any apps that are currently helping people with the problem of distrations and procrastination?
* Then research these products, make sure they exist, build your competitive space to complement what chat GPT has to offer. 
* Narrow down the scope: Ask chat GPT to point us towards the most popular productivity app right now. 

## Narrow down the scope
* Asking Chat GPT about personal uses of productivity apps. 
* Prompt: These are all work productivity apps. Do you know which are the most popular personal productivity apps? Also, I would be interested in learning their strong points and weak points.*

## Understanding what might be the audience for a productivity app
* Prompt: Can you imagine the ideal persona for this productivity app?

## Limitations

- The knowledge and information provided by chat gpt is questionable. 
- We should fact-check everything. 
- The quality of the answer depends on the quality of the prompt and the fact you will insist long enough to get the desired refined answer to your questions. 

## AI tools for market research and competitive analysis

* Chat GPT
* The AI Toolbox for innovators: They have a range of free AI tools, including problem understanding, research scripts, research briefs and can generate personas. While this gives us a good idea of intended users, personas must always be based on user research.
* Dall-E 2: Example to generate persona images
* Miro AI: Transforms new or complex ideas into structured models like user stories, acceptance criteria, technical diagrams and code. *
