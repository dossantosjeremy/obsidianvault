# Synthesis

- Visual AI tools (e.g. prototyping, wireframing…) are still infant technology
- Using a feature list from an app you can feed it into a wireframe generator and generate and build on top of it
- You can edit the feature list of the prototype using Chat GPT
- Then you can move it into figma to create wireframes, they will be generated based on the feature description used with GPT.  

  

Example prompt: Describe how these features would look in an interface, the exact elements they would contain: App Blocking: This feature directly addresses (……)

  

Take the detailed feature list and feed it into the Figma plugin that generates wireframes. 

  

**If working on paper first**

AI can help digitize paper wireframes. 

Make them pixel perfect. 

  

**AI design tools can also convert high-fidelity designs to wireframes**

- When taking older projects that are not correctly documented and do not have source files. 
- Peel back and analyze a competitor interface to seek inspiration for the design. 

- If following this route: Focus on the user and research to validate design decisions. 
- (You do not want to refer to poorly implemented design decisions to inspire work). 

- Testing the product: even if you have high fidelity designs, you may want to use lower fidelity version for usability rtesting 

- Participants will not be distracted by superficial elements and will focus on the task at hand. 
- They won’t feel the work is final and will be more open to giving feedback. 

  

**Ai tools for wireframing**

1. [WireGen](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1221144015267698736/wiregen-ai-gpt-wireframe-generation): This Figma plugin generates editable wireframes based on text descriptions.
2. [Visily](https://www.visily.ai/): This AI-powered wireframe tool transforms screenshots or text prompts into editable wireframes and prototypes. It comes with a pre-built component library to support teams that prefer to work from scratch. It also offers the ability to switch between low- and high-fidelity designs. Visily supports collaborative editing so remote teams can work on the same design. In addition, it offers brainstorming tools such as flowcharts and sticky notes to keep all design process deliverables in one place. It also integrates with Figma. 
3. [Typper](https://www.typper.io/): This is a virtual design assistant that offers design suggestions to improve the layout and accessibility of your interfaces. It also generates text, icons and images based on text prompts.

  

AI Tools can help you avoid the fear of the blank page. 

It will work well only if you have clearly defined requirements. 

More abstract ideas: Teams will always need a designer.

**Raw**

An illustrated gif that demonstrates AI tools for prototyping wireframes. There are three rectangular shapes, one that says "Application features" and has lines of different lengths underneath that represents text or features. The next rectangle has the ChatGPT logo. Finally, on the right, there's the final rectangle that has the Figma logo, a small white block that has the text "WireGen" and a basic illustration of a mobile screen wireframe. Animated dots move from the first rectangle to the second and third.

_Wireframes are the foundation of the interface design processâ€”often one of the first few deliverables in a design project. One of the biggest challenges designers face while creating the initial sketches, is the blank page. Enter generative AI tools!_

_In this video, AI Product Designer Ioana Teleanu, demonstrates how generative AI can give you a head-start on your interface design process._

If you prefer working on paper firstâ€”and we highly recommend it tooâ€”AI tools can act as your personal assistant to digitize your sketches and make them pixel-perfect for you!

Some AI-enabled design tools also offer to convert high-fidelity designs back to wireframes. These can come in handy in the following situations:

- When you take on an older project which is poorly documented or doesnâ€™t have source files that are compatible with the latest design tools.

- When you want to peel back and analyze a competitorâ€™s interfaces to seek inspiration for your designs. If you follow this route, remember to focus on your users and research to validate design decisions. After all, you donâ€™t want to refer to poorly implemented design decisions to inspire your work!

- When you want to test your product. You might have a high-fidelity design, but you may want to use a lower-fidelity version of your application for usability testing. Users will likely give you better feedback on a grayed-out version of an application, without branding elements. Your test participants wonâ€™t be distracted by superficial elements and will focus on the task at hand. They also wonâ€™t feel like the work is â€œfinalâ€ and hence will be more open to giving feedback.

**The Take Away**

AI-powered tools can help you analyze project requirements and suggest wireframes to help you get started with interface design. For example, if you have an idea of what feature you want to build, you can use a tool such as ChatGPT to define what the interface for that feature might look like. With this input, you can use specialized tools and plugins to give you a starter wireframe that you can continue working with.

AI tools can help you overcome the dreaded blank page. But it works well only if you have clearly defined requirements. When it comes to more abstract ideas, teams will always need a designer to turn the idea into something more tangible.
