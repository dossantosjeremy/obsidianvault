**3.5: Build Your Portfolio: Use AI to Prototype Your Idea**

  

**Synthesis**

1. Pick a feature from your app
2. Use AI Tool to identify different screens this feature will require
3. Prompt the tool to generate a detailed description for each screen, including all interface elements. 
4. Depending on the tools that are used: Generate wireframes and then turn them into high fidelity UI
5. Directly create the high fidelity UI
6. Tweak the wireframes as required

  

**Raw Material**

  

  

It’s now time to apply your learnings to continue to build your portfolio!

You can continue building on your previous portfolio activity (lesson 2.10), or experiment with another project, if you’d like. The aim here is to create a prototype of one of your ideas using an AI-powered tool:

1. Pick one of the features for your project that you ideated with AI.
2. Use an AI tool to identify different screens this feature will require.
3. Continue prompting the tool to generate a detailed description for each screen—including all the interface elements. This output will be the input for the next step.
4. Depending on which tool you’re experimenting with, you can either generate wireframes and then turn them into high-fidelity interfaces, or directly create the high-fidelity UI.
5. Tweak the wireframes and high-fidelity interfaces as required.

**Wrap Up**

Write a summary on the efficacy of the prototyping tools and share it with the discussion group. How much effort did you need to put in to make the interfaces usable and presentable?

Remember to document all your hard work—and to show off your work in your portfolio.

  

Proper documentation will help strengthen your portfolio.
