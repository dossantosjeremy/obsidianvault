# Intro 
* Understanding capabilities and limitations of AI
* Understanding the context in which it will be used

# Format
* Specify the format
	* Example: Write a 3-paragraph summary of the following article
* Be specific, mention the final structure you want your information in

# Context 

Provide context: Helps guide the AI towards a more accurate response. For instance provide a 
		* Brief overview of previous exchanges
		* Description of the current situation

# Examples
Provide examples
			* Examples: Few-Shot Prompts, One-Shot Prompts
		* The model attempts to see a patterns in the examples to formulate a reponse. 
Showing examples of what a correct response looks like is really useful. 


# Use tools
 Examples: The prompt perfect plugin, prompt templates

# Iterate and refine

Iterate and refinement
		* Adjust the specificity, tone and format of the prompt
		* It takes approx. 4-6 iterations of a prompt to achieve the best results
	* Creating effective prompts involve a process of trial and error. 
	* Continually testing will lead to better results over time.
