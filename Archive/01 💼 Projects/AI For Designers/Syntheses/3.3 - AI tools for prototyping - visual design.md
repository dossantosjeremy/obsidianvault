**Notes from the video**

- Tools generating UI design from prompts are far from producing spectacular results. There is still a need to edit. 
- We need to edit and refining.  
- Accelerating the exploration and learning that happens when refining design solutions. 
- Generating eight different design concepts with the highest fidelity, keeping the ones we like the best 
- Adding them to a testing platform
- Testing them
- Seeing which ones perform better, keep only the 2
- Iterating and testing them again

  

**Using a UI Design Generator**

- Feeding a feature list
- Add a layer of personaization and sparks
- Example

- We want a an with pomodoro… 
- Make it in the stile of headspace, with coloured illustrations and an orange dominant theme. 

- It can serve as a starting point. 
- This is baby, infant technology. 

  

**Takeaway**

- Huge library of icons and pre-built components. 
- As a UI Designer - what you have to do is pick which ones to use and where. 
- As the AI tools are evolving, you cannot think only about one aspect only. 
- You must think big picture. 
- Become a manager of AI Resources that can do the mundane heavy lifting work to implement a vision. 

  

**AI Tools for UI Design**

1. [Uizard](https://uizard.io/?utm_source=interactiondesign&utm_medium=partnership&utm_campaign=partner_interactiondesign): A versatile design tool for wireframes, mockups, and prototypes. It enables text prompt-based interface generation, converting hand-drawn sketches into wireframes, and reverse-engineering screenshots. It has pre-made templates and UI components for interfaces, with both a drag-and-drop editor and Figma integration.
2. [Galileo AI](https://www.usegalileo.ai/): Generates high-fidelity, editable UI designs from simple text descriptions. The tool combines UI components, along with AI-generated images and content, to turn natural language prompts into visually appealing designs. Galileo AI integrates with Figma, which allows you to easily incorporate AI-generated designs into your projects.

**Reflexion on the value of AI Tools for my learning**

  

As a UX Researcher with no background in visual design, they will help me reduce the friction associated with learning UI Design in order to design a product. They will also help me not fear the blank page anymore. 

  

However, as much as they will serve as a basis for me to learn more about UI design and kickstart my ideas, I am aware I must be cautious of the outputs and use it sparingly. 

  

What I believe is interesting is that it can act as an assistant, a teacher, providing me examples of how to apply design principles, exactly for my use-case. 

  

This way, it will provide material that is much more relevant to my needs. There is less gap between the theory and the practice as it can help me visualize how theory will materialise in my project, directly.

_Imagine if you had a genie you could summon to come up with different concepts for your interface. Imagine no more. While the technology is still in its infancy, generative AI tools can help you exponentially speed up your visual design process, giving you a decent starting point to refine and iterate._

Here AI Product Designer Ioana Teleanu demonstrates the capabilities of generative AI tools for visual design using Uizard.

**The Take Away**

AI-assisted visual design tools make a pretty lofty promise to their users: that people can design applications without any design experience. This statement is only partly true.

Itâ€™s not just the AI tools now, but over the years, lots of the work that visual designers have done has been steadily replaced. For example, the Material Design guidelines come with a huge library of icons and pre-built components. As a UI designer, all you have to do is pick which ones to use and where.

No AI tool can fully replace a designer. However, as technology continues to evolve, your role as a visual designer will change. You will no longer handcraft individual deliverables. Instead, you must think about the â€œbig pictureâ€ to evaluate the work of AI and decide whether it truly fits into the product, or if it needs iterations. Aim to become a â€œmanagerâ€ of AI resources that can do the mundane, heavy-lifting work to implement your vision.
