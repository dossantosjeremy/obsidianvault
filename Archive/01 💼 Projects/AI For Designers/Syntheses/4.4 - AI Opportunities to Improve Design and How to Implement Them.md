# Opportunities to include AI in products 

## Video summary
- How can AI impact digital products:
	- Personalization - tailored adaptive products
	- Context: Understanding user context and needs
	- Efficiency: Speed of animations
	- Better use of user patterns and understanding
	- Testing
	- Automation: Customer support, error recognition
	- Support users through their goals.

### Where to incorporate AI in products and solutions

### Increase efficiency
* E.g. Siri remembering what you do at certain times of the day to suggest it to you later. *
* E.g. Google Glide typing, voice typiing or frequently used words
* Consider how we can save users' time, resources and costs with AI-powered solutions. Example: If a driver needs to deliver five packages across town, the AI tool could suggest the shortest route, factoring in traffic conditions and road conditions to ensure a smooth ride.

### Reduce or eliminate mundane tasks
* Boring, repetitive takss
* That require no decision making.
* Meal planning
* Video transcription
* Managing a personal calendar
* Example: Use generative fill in photoshop. 
* Implement automations in my products as well. Accounting tool 
* Automation is not always the best solution. 
* Just because a task can be automated does not mean it should. 
* Situations in which people would prefer to do the tasks themselves: The ones that are at high stakes and for which they are personally responsible. 
* Do not default to automation. 
* Run user research to determine to what extent people would like their tasks to be automated. 


### Support user tasks
* Main goal of a designer: Solve problems and help users complete their tasks. 
* The product should be as invisible as possible. 
* Consider how the product can support the users. 
* AI can help users accomplish tasks that were previously not possible or not easily accessible. 
* Apple fitness app: Gamifies physical fitness with monthly challenges. Tailored to the user current physical activity to help them achieve and maintain a healthy lifestyle.

### Improve safety and health
- AI can keep users safe through real time data processing. 
- Example apple devicesdetecting users' falling. 

### Takeaway

Remember that AI is not always necessary. As a designer, your goal is to solve problems and help people meet their goals. Find out what these goals and problems are through user research. Ideate holistic solutions over individual features and then consider how AI can help optimize the solutions.
