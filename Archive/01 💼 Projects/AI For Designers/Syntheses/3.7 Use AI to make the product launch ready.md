- Logo creation process demonstration with mid journey
- With midjourney we can control a lot of prelaunch topics

- Logo 
- Appstore logo
- Illustrations
- Marketing Images
- Photos of the app in the style of dribbble and behance
- To prompt mid journey we need to be specific but not necessarily over describe as more detail will not necessarily bring better results.
- Once we created a midjourney account we can go to the newbies channel or prompting midjourney itself. 
- We should write imagine and a prompt to see the magic happen
- The U button allows to upscale the image. 
- The V button allows to create 4 new variations of the selected image. 
- There is also a rerun button to rerun the prompt and generate new images. 
- We can also prompt midjourney to generate marketing images in the style of dribbble and behance to generate product images

  

  

  

The result cannot be used without the help of a designer. Nevertheless, the output that was produced can be very helpful at this stage of the design process. 

  

We can see it as a visual inspiration.

**3.7: Use AI to Make Your Product Launch-Ready**

Estimated time to complete: 16 mins

  

You’ve done your homework—researched the problem space, brainstormed ideas and iterated your designs after rigorous testing. You’re now ready to share your solution with the world to help make your users’ lives much better. Here’s a look at how AI can help you make your product launch-ready.

If you’ve worked with mobile applications in the past, then you know the grunt work required to publish the apps to different app stores. While many design tools have long had the ability to auto-export at multiple-resolutions, AI tools can help you create new assets from scratch. In this video, AI Product Designer Ioana Teleanu demonstrates the logo creation process with Midjourney.

1. 00:00:00 --> 00:00:31  
    It's time to get your product ready  for launch. And Midjourney can be an incredible companion at this stage. With Midjourney, you can address a lot of pre-launch needs; things such as creating a logo, an App Store icon, an icon set for  your product; you can create illustrations, you can create marketing images, you can create photos of your app in the style of Dribble
2. 00:00:31 --> 00:01:01  
    and Behance and so much more. When it comes to prompting Midjourney, you need to be specific, but don't over-describe, as more details don't necessarily bring you better results. Once you've created a Midjourney account, you can either go to one of the Newbies channel or you can directly talk to the Midjourney bot if you want a more private space  for creating imagery. What you need to do is write "imagine" and then a prompt and then watch the magic happen.
3. 00:01:01 --> 00:01:32  
    So, here I'm prompting Midjourney to generate a logo for a mobile productivity app. You can actually see it as it's turning random noise into a logo. It's pretty incredible! Okay, so  now it generated four options. I think I like this one the best. The U buttons: upscale the selected  image, creating a new larger version with extra details. The V buttons: create four new variations of the selected image, matching it in style and composition. There's also a Re-run button.
4. 00:01:32 --> 00:02:01  
    That will re-run your prompt and generate four new images For now, let's generate four new images of this one I like the most. So, now I have four new variations. I think I like this one the most. So, I'm going to upscale it, and here it is. Next I'm going to be prompting Midjourney to generate marketing kind of images in the style of Dribble and Behance with our mobile product activity app.
5. 00:02:01 --> 00:02:22  
    You can see that the results that Midjourney generates, even after a couple of tries and refining the prompt, can't be used without the refinement from a human designer. Nevertheless, the output that it produces can be very helpful at this stage of the design process. You can think about it as visual inspiration that accelerates your creative process.

**The Take Away**

That last push to deliver your projects can be monotonous and tiresome. AI image-generating tools can help you quickly jazz up your app store screenshots, scale up your social marketing efforts, and even help you showcase your portfolio through perfectly aligned layouts.

You might still need to tweak them to ensure they match your expectations and style guides. But the tools will take on the bulk of the mundane tasks.
