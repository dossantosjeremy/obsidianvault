## How to supercharge design ideation sessions with AI
1. Start with a problem description
2. Ask the AI to provide a set of features for it
3. Choose one or two features 
4. Ask how they might appear on be achieved
5. Ask about use cases, by referring them as UML use cases to be clear
6. Give AI more context about how or where these features will be used, or about the users
7. Write a short summary of what was asked and ask the AI responses. 
8. Mention strengths and weaknesses of the interaction. 
9. Decide what aspects you might find useful in a real project. 
10. Include the detailed exchange as an appendix to the report.
