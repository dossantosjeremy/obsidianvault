# Video notes
* There is more to personalization than just product recommendations. 
* We could call it personalization or even hyper-personalization. 
* In the future, everyone will see their own personalized version of the internet. 
* The context aware interfaces will likely understand
	* Who you are
	* Where you are
	* What you are trying to achieve
	* What is your goal at that moment
* In order to adapt to give a unique experience
* Product that learns from your UI preferences, adapts dynamically to suit your taste and then adds a context aware layer that understands you are in a certain mode
* We can imagine ephemeral apps - when we query chat gpt it leads to an app being built on the spot for the only moment when we need it. 
* With AI we can orchestrate moments, experiences and use-cases. 

# Examples of context-aware experiences

1. Adaptive content: Custom Content Tailored for the individual. 
	1. Marketing products
	2. Education
2. Personalized recomendations
	1. Digital streaming applications using AI to personalize song and movie recommendations. 
	2. Amazon product recommendations. 
	3. Recommendations to any service depending on user needs.
		1. Itineraries and hotel recommendations
		2. Fashion and style recomendations
		3. Personalized magazine
		4. Meal plans and exercise regimes tailored to health conditions. 
3. Adaptive user interfaces. 
	1. Complex applications, offering features by learning from user behavior
	2. Learning from expert users behaviors to develop onboarding programs

# Concerns related to hyper personalization

## Privacy
* AI learns from the user data
* Privacy is a concern
* Seek consent before gathering data
* Make it clear what data you are about to collect and how you plan to use it. 
* Steps you take to secure the data
* Provide an easy way for users to delete their data. 

## Bias
- Social media applications and algorithm perpetuated bias. 
- Training data: Should be as inclusive as possible. 
- Difficult if the training data is crowdsourced
- Build a content - moderation or reviewing mechanism. 

## Fatigue
- Constantly being bombarded by similar content can be monotonous
- AI is trained on past behavior. It cannot predict if people want something new or not. 
- Build feature in the product that allows people to reset the algorithm. 

# Takeaway
- AI offers the potential to build a world tailored for just one single user. 
- Personalization can lead to user fatigue and perpetuate biases
