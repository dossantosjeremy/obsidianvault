# Video transcript synthesis
* AI tools can help us in multiple ways
	* Clustering insights
	* Identifying themes
	* Sentiment analysis
* Overcome limitations of AI: 
	* Have clear goals*
	* Have an efficient scoping
* Data triangulation and cross-referencing insights with other sources is important
* What we can ask AI: What are the main insights from this interview: What are the main problems that Taylor is facing?
* Always use critical thinking to navigate the content generated by AI
* Prioritize these insights using collaborative methods such as dot voting. 
* Leverage the power of AI by having them on a Miro Board and then have them clustered by thematic analysis or sentiment analysis
* We can ask GPT to prioritize these problems and insights: 
	* Prioritize by order of importance
	* Prioritize by how often they were mentioned. 
* Use chat gpt to prioritize insights and see how often they were mentioned

## Takeaway
- Set clear research goals and scope effectively
- Data triangulation and cross-referencing insights with other data sources is criticak
- AI Tools can help prioritize insights 
- Critical thinking is necessary to interpret their content
- A collaborative approach is useful
- AI contributes to the data analysis process but cannot replace it
