# Goal
1. Choose a problem domain that you have some knowledge of.
2. Identify a fairly narrow question in that domain.
3. Ask the question of one or more AI tools.
4. Use critical thinking to evaluate the answers (this is where your existing domain knowledge comes in).
5. Use other sources to fact-check the AI answers. A web search is usually a good place to start.
6. Summarize your findings for your portfolio and share with the discussion group.
