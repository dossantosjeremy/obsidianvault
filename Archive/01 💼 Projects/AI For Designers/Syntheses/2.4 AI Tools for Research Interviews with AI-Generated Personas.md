# Video transcript synthesis

- Simulate a conversation with a persona. 
- This is very controversial
- You will get stereotypical data
- You can use it as a starting point to map out the main themes
- Talk to real users to challenge and validate your initial research. 
- You can spot ideas worth investigating further based on a conversation with AI
- Imagine a fictional conversation with a persona
- We are going to ask chat gpt to imagine an interview script and then generate the interview
- Prompt to generate an interview script: "Can you give me an interview script for anÂ interview unpacking productivity problems with Taylor?"
- You can never replace real users in the process. The interview with GPT will give you stereotypical data.
- Turn this interview script into an actual conversation with Taylor. 
- Interviews are mostly based on statistical information so they cannot possibly capture the nuances and details such as with real people
- That is why it is really important to include real people in the process. 
- We can also complement real data from interviews with AI generated data
