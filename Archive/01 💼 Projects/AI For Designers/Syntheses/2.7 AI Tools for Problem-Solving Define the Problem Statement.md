# Limitations of AI Tools

- AI Tools can help us move from research to a problem definition
- They cannot serve as a replacement to ideation. 
- Design is conversation and collaboration
- It is in a group of people that the magic happens

# Use of Chat GPT
* Generate a problem statement
* Generate How Might We's 
* Generate User Stories

# Defining the problem statement
1. The input data should be clean, interpreted and prioritized
2. Define the problem statement
3. Aiming to solve the problem statement. The problem statement should be specific and goal oriented
4. Define the set of features
5. Define the set of user stories
# How can AI Help
1. Ai can be a conversation partner
2. Synthesis is one of its best abilities
3. The data we feed should be clean, interpreted and prioritized
4. The quality of the result is dependent on the quality of the input
5. Provide as much detail as possible
	1. Format
	2. Examples
6. Ask GPT to write a problem statement based on the insights we generated so far
	1. Be specific 
	2. Mention the goal I am looking for with this exercise
	3. Prompt: Using the problems and priorities you've listed above consolidate everything into a single problem statement that will serve as the design goal we set to solve as we continue with the UX process.
	4. In general the answer is too long
	5. So we should ask it to shorten it: Can you shorten this
	6. The more concise a problem statement the easier it is to socialize with people in the team
7. Pause the AI Generated process and apply critical thinking
	1. The problem statement given by ChatGPT is generic
	2. You would have to refine it a lot or rewrite it completely.
8. Make the problem statement evolve into tangible design questions and actions by formulating how might wes and user stories
	1. Based on this problem statement can you formulate 4 How Might We's?
9. To create user stories, we can ask GPT to transform this into user stories. 
10. Move all this in Miro to be easier to move around, cluster by themes, socialize with the rest of the team. 



# Takeaway
1. Clean, interpreted and prioritized data
2. Provide as many instructions as possible
3. Specfici and goal oriented problem statement
4. How might we: Formulate actionable design questions based on the problem statement
5. User Stories to be generated from these questions
