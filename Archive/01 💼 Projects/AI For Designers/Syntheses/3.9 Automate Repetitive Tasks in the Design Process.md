**Collaboration and Productivity Tools**

Communication and collaboration are two of the most important aspects of a designer’s role. Here are some AI tools that can help free up your time and reduce the mental energy needed to handle the more administrative side of work. These tools are examples of generative AI, a form of narrow AI.

1. [**Sembly AI**](https://www.sembly.ai/): This tool generates **meeting notes** with a summary and the topics discussed during a meeting. It supports over 40 languages (many of which are in Beta) and integrates with common task management and collaboration tools such as Slack and Trello. You can also prompt the tool to search for past meetings, filter out discussion points based on specific criteria (such as challenges or opportunities), summarize the meeting in a few lines or help you write an email based on the discussions.
2. [**Otter.ai**](https://otter.ai/): Offers **live meeting transcriptions** and generates summaries. It integrates with popular meeting apps to work as soon as a meeting starts, without manual intervention.  
    

4. _You can chat with the AI assistant during the meeting so that teammates can focus on the meeting while AI answers follow-up questions.

5. [**Reclaim AI**](https://reclaim.ai/): A **scheduling automation app** that finds the best time for your meetings, tasks, habits and breaks. You can set time aside for recurrent meetings, focus time or personal times. The application automatically reschedules tasks in case there are conflicts with meetings and helps you manage your time effectively.
6. [**Ellie**](https://tryellie.com/): An **email writing assistant**. It frees up time and mental bandwidth by drafting intelligent emails. Powered by GPT, the tool learns from your writing style and crafts replies as if they were written by you. 
7. [**Taskade**](https://www.taskade.com/templates/design): A multi-purpose **productivity AI tool** that offers features such as workflow automation, visualization and chat. From a designer’s perspective, it offers pre-built checklists for common design tasks.

**Design Assistants**

There are several niche tools to perform design tasks. These tools are also classified as generative AI, a type of narrow AI that generates content based on AI prompts. Here are some tools to help you get unstuck while working on your digital product:

**1. Research Assistant**

AI can **automate** your user research efforts at **scale**. It can combine industry expertise and best practices and offer suggestions that are tailored to your context. You can share your research goals and let the tools plan and even run your research.

Here are some examples:

- [**Hotjar AI**](https://www.hotjar.com/product-ai-surveys/) can help you draft survey questions.
- [**UserTesting AI**](https://www.usertesting.com/platform/data-machine-learning) can analyze your audience data and help recruit participants for your research efforts.
- [**Pansophic**](https://pansophic.co/) can learn about your product and research goals to conduct a qualitative interview with your users.

**2. Data Processing and Analysis**

The biggest advantage of AI is in data processing. It can **recognize patterns** at **scale**. When you have a vast amount of qualitative data, it can become overwhelming and time-consuming to sift through it all. Here, too, AI can **automate** data processing and summarize insights that you can then apply directly to your design work.

Most research tools (including the ones listed in the previous section) also include data analysis and reporting tools. In addition, some other options are:

- [**Miro**](https://miro.com/ai/)’s AI features include clustering sticky notes to identify patterns.
- [**UX Brain**](https://www.stork.ai/ai-tools/ux-brain-2b397) is a dedicated research “sidekick” that transcribes audio and video data and summarizes findings.

**3. Brainstorming Partner**

AI can act as your sounding board and **suggest ideas**. Collaborative tools such as [**Whimsical**](https://whimsical.com/ai/ai-mind-maps), [**Taskade**](https://www.taskade.com/templates/mindmap) and [**Slatebox**](https://slatebox.com/) all provide AI-powered suggestions as part of the mind mapping features.

_Here, Whimsical demonstrates how its AI would act to generate a mind map about mind maps._

**4. Logo and Icon Inspiration**

Most icon generators focus on logos and app icons. You can use the output of these tools as-is, or use them as a **starting point** for your work. Sometimes you might find that standard icon libraries do not have an icon that represents an abstract concept that’s unique to your product. In such cases, you can experiment with these tools to create such icons. There are several standalone icon generators such as [**IconlabAI**](https://www.iconlabai.com/), [**CandyIcons**](https://www.candyicons.com/) and [**Diffusion Logo Studio**](https://diffusion-logo-studio.gradientinsight.com/).

**5. Stock Image Search**

When creative commons or royalty-free images become too stock-ish and don’t provide exactly what you’re looking for, AI image generators can help you create **custom images**. Whether it is marketing illustrations or photorealistic faces for your personas, tools such as [**Midjourney**](https://www.midjourney.com/home/), [**Stable Diffusion**](https://stablediffusionweb.com/) and [**DALL·E 2**](https://openai.com/dall-e-2) can generate these from text inputs/prompts.

**6. Color Palette Inspiration**

AI tools such as [**Khroma**](https://www.khroma.co/), [**ColorMagic**](https://colormagic.app/) and [**Chroma AI**](https://chroma.szhao.dev/) can help you come up with a visual language based on your tastes, specific keywords or even random phrases.

**7. Writing Assistants and Copywriters**

Writing assistants can help you in:

- Digital marketing: create ad copy, social media content, email marketing campaigns and other branding-related communication.
- Content creation: generate SEO-friendly blog posts, website copy and meta descriptions.
- Microcopy: generate clear messages for instructions, error states, help text and other UI-related content.

Some tools to help you with writing tasks are:

- [**Notion AI**](https://www.notion.so/product/ai): Brainstorm ideas, create outlines, summarize notes, edit voice and tone to suit your audience, all in a collaborative workspace.
- [**Grammarly**](https://www.grammarly.com/ai-writing-tools): End-to-end writing assistance that provides starter text and suggests revisions to refine the output.
- [**Writesonic**](https://writesonic.com/), [**Jasper**](https://www.jasper.ai/) and [**Copy.ai**](https://www.copy.ai/) are dedicated long-form content generation tools that can learn your brand voice and generate SEO-optimized blog posts.

**8. Marketing and Presentation Tools**

AI tools can **automate** the grunt work involved in the supplementary activities related to products. For example:

- [**Tome**](https://tome.app/), [**Beautiful.ai**](https://www.beautiful.ai/) and [**Slides AI**](https://www.slidesai.io/) can help you put together presentation slides.
- [**Canva**](https://www.canva.com/magic/) and [**Midjourney**](https://www.midjourney.com/home/) can help you create marketing assets in different resolutions.

**3.9: Design Freedom: Automate Repetitive Tasks in the Design Process**

Estimated time to complete: 15 mins

  

AI tools can make the design process extremely efficient by taking on heavy but mundane tasks such as data processing and translating low-fidelity designs to pixel-perfect layouts. Alongside these “main” design tasks, technology can help you optimize even the seemingly smaller side tasks and activities. Let’s see how.

1. 00:00:00 --> 00:00:31  
    The stages of the UX process are  not singular in offering opportunities for enhancing our ways of working. We can also look into automating side process things such as productivity or collaboration. I would personally start with the parts that we're naturally not very good at or the ones we don't enjoy doing. Who  wouldn't be excited to get rid of some of the menial tasks?
2. 00:00:31 --> 00:01:03  
    So, here are some ideas for using AI  in our design work: Creating icons with Midjourney; generating presentations with tools such as Tome or Beautiful.AI; stock imagery with Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion; color palettes with Chroma; writing documentation with Notion AI, writing with Grammarly, and many other options. The landscape of AI tools is rapidly changing. So many new capabilities pop up every week. The best best way to explore ways of optimizing your work is to go to
3. 00:01:03 --> 00:01:22  
    platforms like Futurepedia and see what's new, play around with the tools, learn and experiment on your own. I choose to set aside 2-3 hours  in my calendar every week, AI playground time, where I simply experiment as much as I can with whatever I stumble upon. It may be something worth trying.
