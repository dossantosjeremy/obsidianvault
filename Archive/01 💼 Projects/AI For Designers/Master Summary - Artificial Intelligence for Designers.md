		* If the problem statement is too long, we should ask Chat GPT to shorten it
		* We might have to refine it or to rewrite it completely


* Prioritizing the insights
	* Have them on a Miro board and have them clustered by thematic analysis or sentiment analysis
	* Use Chat GPT to prioritize the insights, by:
		* Order of importance
		* How often they were mentioned. 
* Define stage
	* Process to follow with ChatGPT
		* Choose a product area in which you have experience
		* Choose a problem statement
		* Identify narrow questions in that domain: We want answers from a few hundred words, not a few thousands.

	* Design Principles
	* Market research and competitive analysis
		* Example prompt: *Are there any apps that are currently helping people with the problem of distrations and procrastination?
		* Making your own research and complement what Chat GPT has to offer.

		* Example: *These are all work productivity apps. Do you know which are the most popular personal productivity apps? Also, I would be interested in learning their strong points and weak points.*
		* Personas
			* Understanding who might be the audience. 
			* Imagine personas with ChatGPT. 
				* Example: *Can you imagine the ideal persona for this productivity app?*
			* Generate persona images with Dall-E 
			* Generate personas:  **[User Persona](https://userpersona.dev/)**: Lets you enter a description of your product or service and generates a user persona for you.
* Ideation
	* Design generation
		* Start with a problem description
	* Use AI tools to generate how might we's

			* Consider the responses if they look reasonable based on the information provided
			* Ask the tool to provide sources to adjust the responses
		* Example prompt: *We can ask Chat GPT to transform all of this into user stories*
	* Define the set of features
		* Ask the AI to provide a set of features for it
		* Then choose one or two features
		* Ask how they might appear or be achieved
		* Ask the AI about use cases, by referring them as UML use cases
		* Give AI more context about how oe where these features will be used, or about the users
		* Think about what the product needs to do
		* Think about who the users are
		* Ask yourself if the AI suggestion covers them
			* If not, consider asking the AI to make adjustments
			* Consider rephrasing the question. 
		* Example prompt: *"We want to create a website that would allow users to buy clothes based on their impact on the environment. What kind of features would that site need to have?" (The answer was about 240 words.)*

* Evaluation
	* We should
		* Evaluate the interfaces using heuristic or heatmap prediction tools
		* Follow up with a usability test with real users
		* Compare the findings
		* A/B test the process by conducting usability testing before and after the AI evaluation
	* Necessary to use our judgement and not rely solely on AI-generated data
	* 
	* Some of the tools use heatmaps to tell us where are our users looking. 
	* What are the areas of the UI that would draw the most user attention. 
	* Some of them also show a clarity score showing how clear the design would be for a given user, the amount of text, text size, text contrast...
	* We can test several solutions generated by AI before making a decision of which one we pursue. 
	* Use lower fidelity versions to test the design first. 
		* This way participants will not be distracted by superficial elements and will focus on the task at hand. 
		* They won't feel the work is final and will be open to feedback. 
	* Insights generator
		* Summarize user research sessions based only on transcript
		* Provide tags for the thematic analysis of data
		* Analyze research notes and create themes and insights based on inputs from multiple sources. 
	* Spot usability issues early on
	* Processing large amounts of data
	* Provides more insights into the user behavior
	* Follow-up the automated tools with usability tests with real users. 
	* Usability study:
		* Behavior should be analyzed by a human
		* Never analyze a usability test based only on what participants say. 
	* Tools we can use
		*  [**Attention Insight**](https://attentioninsight.com/)**:** This tool predicts where users will look after engaging with your design. Apart from predictive heatmaps, it can help you compare designs—you can use alternate versions of the same design or even a competitor’s design to evaluate how well your interface performs.
		* [**Predict by Neurons**](https://www.neuronsinc.com/predict)**:** Also generates predictive heatmaps of where your audience might look at your designs and has very similar features to Attention Insight, including integration with popular design software. The main difference between the two tools lies in the AI’s underlying “training”. While Attention Insight bases its predictions on eye-tracking studies, Predict uses data from eye-tracking and neuroscientific experiments.
		* [**3M’s Visual Attention System (VAS)**](https://vas.3m.com/)**:** This tool is similar to the above two predictive heatmap tools and extends to physical environments in addition to digital interfaces.
		* [**Heurix**](https://www.heurix.io/)**:** A heuristic analysis tool that conducts a UX audit of a website and automatically generates a report highlighting the areas of improvement.
		* [**UserTesting AI**](https://www.usertesting.com/platform/AI)**:** Helps synthesize large volumes of video, text and behavioral data to identify key themes, patterns and insights. The tool’s sentiment analysis feature focuses on what users _say_ during a testing session. Its friction detection focuses on behavioral cues (what users actually _do_) to pinpoint the exact places where participants had difficulty interacting with websites or prototypes during tests.
