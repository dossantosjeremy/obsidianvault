## Insights generator
* Summarizing each session based on a transcript
* Lacking additional information like context, past research or background details about the product and user

## AI collaborators
- Recommending tags for thematic analysis
- Analyze notes, creating themes and insights based on inputs from multiple sources
- Analyze user research notes
- Difficulty in handling visual data
- Issues with citations and validation
- Introduction of bias into research results


## Limitations
* Visual Input processing
* Usability Testing
* Do not trust blindly these systems
* Lacking context (e.g. research goals and product information)
* Lac of citation and limitation
* Several types of bias:
	* Systematic (training data)
	* Statistical and computational (sample not big enough or representative enough, or in the algorithm itself)
	* Human bias (e.g. anchoring bias)
* issues can happen at various stages of the design process
* Take everything with a grain of salt

## Overcoming limitations
* Use diverse and representative data
* Test and audit AI systems
* Provide clear guidelines
