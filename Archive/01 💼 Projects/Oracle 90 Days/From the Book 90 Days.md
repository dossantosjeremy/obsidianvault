![[The first 90 days 🌅 4.jpeg]]


You can do a lot to compensate for your vulnerabilities. Basic tools are self-discipline, team building, and advice and a sel. You need to discipline yourself to devote time to critical ac ties that you do not enjoy and that may not come naturally. Bey that, actively search out people in your organization whose are sharp in these areas, so that they can serve as a backstop for and you can learn from them. A network of advisers and counse can also help you move beyond your comfort zone.

Your strengths can be a weakness, example having too much attention to detail. 

Embrace the need to learn

### Embrace the network
- At the beginning of a career, be counselled by technical people
- Then on politics

### Watch out people who hold you back
- Clear expectations: what you will do and not do
- If people are not accepting your move you need to move them out of the organization quickly

### Get some help
- Take advantage of everything the organisation has to offer
- Ask manager and HR for 90-day transition plan
- Find out if there are competency models describing your role
- Ask for help in identifying and connecting with key stakeholders or finding a cultural interpreter

### Closing the loop 
- Look for vulnerabilities (analysis of problem preferences)
- Think about how to compensate for it
- Think about external forced that will hold le back

![[The first 90 days 🌅 6.jpeg]]



## Accelerate your learning 
- Accelerate learning as much as possible
- Create a learning plan 
- Ask about the history of the org “how did we get to this point”
- Do not be over pressured to act, rather, try to learn
- Shows credibility and influence 
- Have in mind your do not necessarily have THE amswer. What worked in past organizations might not work in this one
- There is a need to learn org structures and politics
- Define a learning agenda which includes what needs to be learned 

![[The first 90 days 🌅 7.jpeg]]



![[The first 90 days 🌅 8.jpeg]]


![[The first 90 days 🌅 9.jpeg]]


- Learn from the cultural, interpersonal, technical and political front
- Best source for some insight is going to be talking to people who have the information about company culture, politics, strategy, technical capabilities…. 
- The more we have different point of views the more insights will be deepened 


![[The first 90 days 🌅 10.jpeg]]


![[The first 90 days 🌅 11.jpeg]]


![[The first 90 days 🌅 12.jpeg]]


- Asking the question how best we can learn
- Only talking to people eill be inefficient
- Meet people 1-1 first then collectively 
- Then follow a structured approach for instance using a script

![[The first 90 days 🌅 13.jpeg]]


- Pay attention to how people answer: if they anser directlt, are evasive, if they reject the fault…
- Finish with a group discussion 
- Tailor your questions to the group you are interacting with
- Process at ge: the leader meets with a buddy
Other effective methodologies to learn or SWOT swat strengths with weaknesses, opportunities and threats


![[The first 90 days 🌅 14.jpeg]]

The learning plan should be part of the first 90 days plan in fact it should last around 30 days on the job 

The learning plan is typical with a phase in which we collect information analyse and distillate and develop and test hypothesis to progressively deepen or understanding of our new organisation 


![[The first 90 days 🌅 15.jpeg]]


![[The first 90 days 🌅 16.jpeg]]


![[The first 90 days 🌅 17.jpeg]]

- Ask for help
- Clise the loop: ask the boss how to get early wins and get supportive coalition 

![[The first 90 days 🌅 18.jpeg]]


- Match strategy to situation 
	- What kind of change am i being called to have
	- What is my leadership style?
- Using the stars model

### Principles for effective negotiation

Negotiate for Resources
As you seek commitments for resources, keep these principles of effective negotiation in mind.

Focus on underlying interests. Probe as deeply as possible to understand the agendas of your boss and any others from whom you need to secure resources. What is in it for them?
Look for mutually beneficial exchanges. Seek resources that both support your boss’s agenda and advance your own. Look for ways to help peers advance their agendas in return for help with yours.
Link resources to results. Highlight the performance benefits that will result if more resources are dedicated to your unit. Create the menu described earlier, laying out what you can achieve (and cannot achieve) with current resources and what different-sized increments would allow you to do.


### Planning the style conversation 

 In the style conversation, your agenda is to determine how you and your boss can best work together on a continuing basis.

Diagnose Your Boss’s Style
The first step is to diagnose your new boss’s working style and figure out how it jibes with your own. If you leave messages for her about an urgent problem, and she doesn’t respond quickly but then reproaches you for not giving her a heads-up about the problem, take note: your boss doesn’t use that mode of communication!

How does your boss like to communicate? How often? What kinds of decisions does he want to be involved in, and when can you make calls on your own? Does your boss arrive at the office early and work late? Does he expect others to do the same?
Pinpoint the specific ways in which your styles differ, and assess what those differences imply about how you will interact.

You may find it helpful to talk to others who have worked with your boss in the past. Naturally, you must do this judiciously. Be careful not to be perceived as eliciting criticism of how the boss leads. Stick to less fraught issues, such as how the boss prefers to communicate.

Observe, too, how your boss deals with others. Is there consistency? If not, why not? Does the boss have favorites? Is he particularly prone to micromanaging certain issues? Has he come down hard on a few people because of unacceptable performance?

### Adapt to Your Boss’s Style
- Assume that the job of building a positive relationship with your new boss is 100 percent your responsibility. In short, this means adapting to his style. If your boss hates voice messages, don’t leave them. If he wants to know in detail what is going on, overcommunicate
- Smooth out relationships
- Others who have worked with your boss can tell you what approaches they found successful. Then judiciously experiment with the tactics that seem most promising in your case. When in doubt, simply ask your boss how he would prefer you to proceed.

### Planning the personal development conversation 

Others who have worked with your boss can tell you what approaches they found successful. Then judiciously experiment with the tactics that seem most promising in your case. When in doubt, simply ask your boss how he would prefer you to proceed.

Planning the Personal Development Conversation
It’s especially critical that you do this when you’re making key career passages. If you’re a first-time manager, get into the habit early of asking your boss for feedback and help in developing your supervisory skills. Your willingness to seek candid feedback on your strengths and weaknesses—and, critically, your ability to act on the feedback—sends a powerful message.

Whenever you are at a point in your career when success demands a different set of skills and attitudes, discipline yourself to be open to learning from others who have gone before you.

### Soft skills to develop
Don’t restrict your focus to hard skills. The higher you rise, the more important the key soft skills of cultural and political diagnosis, negotiation, coalition building, and conflict management will become. Formal training can help, but developmental assignments—in project teams, in new parts of the organization, in different functions, in different locations—are indispensable in honing these key managerial skills.

Working with Multiple Bosses
If you have multiple bosses, you must be sure to carefully balance perceived wins and losses among them. If one boss has substantially more power, then it makes sense to bias yourself somewhat in her direction early on, as long as you redress the balance, to the greatest extent possible, later. If you can’t get agreement by working with your bosses one-on-one, you must essentially force them to come to the table together to thrash issues out

## Match strategy to situation

(Take the notes from the physical book again)

## Chapter 4 - Negotiate Success

I want to operate on a 90-day time frame, starting with 30 days to get on top of things,” he told her. “Then I will bring you a detailed assessment and plan with goals and actions for the next 60 days.” Michael updated her regularly on his progress. Pressed by her to make a call on a major systems purchase after three weeks, Michael held firm to his schedule. At the end of 30 days, he delivered a strong plan that pleased his new boss.

Building on his momentum, Michael raised the question of style at their next meeting: “We have different styles, but I can deliver for you,” he said. “I want you to judge me on my results, not on how I get them.” It took nearly a year, but Michael built a solid, productive working relationship with Vaughan.

- Negotiate Success with the boss because it is the person that will have the most impact on the career and how fast you reach break even
- The higher you rise in an organization and the more autonomy you should get. 
- Building a productive workinga relationship: As soon as you start being considered for the role. 
- Even if you change only roles and not boss, the working relationship might differ in the end. 
- Also think about how you can accelerate relationship building with direct reports.

**Take time to plan for each conversation and signal to boss what we hope to accomplish in each exchange**


![[Apple Notes/Image.png]]


**Guidelines to plan each of the following conversations**

### Planning the situation conversation
The goal of the first conversation is to arrive at a shared understanding of the situation of the company 

Then, match support to situation by determining how the boss can help you. 


![[Image 1.png]]


**Expectations conversation**
- Clarify and align expectations about the future
- Agree on short and medium term goals and timing
- Align on how boss will measure progress
- What will constitute success for the boss and me
- When does the boss expect to see results
- How will you measure success
- On what time frame
- Match expectations to the situation
- Pinpoint what is most important for boss to secure early wins in these areas
- Most effective approach:
	- Integrate boss goals with own effort to get early wins
	- If not base early wins solely on boss priorities
- Identify the untouchable: What the boss is sensitive about
	- Understand boss personal history 
	- Talking to others
	- Paying close attention to facial expressions, tone and body language
	- If uncertain: Float an idea as a trial balloon and watch reactions. 
- Educate boss
	- Shape perception of what you can and should achieve
	- Work hard to make views converge
	- Educate boss and reset expectations

<b><u>UNDERPROMISE AND OVERDELIVER.</u></b> 

 Clarify as much as possible
- Put yourself in boss’s shoes 
- Understand how his boss will evaluate him.
- Don’t let key issues remain ambiguous
- Ambiguity is dangerous

## Resources Conversation
- First, agree on stars portfolio and associated goals and expectations. 
- Secure resources needed to meet these expectations. 
Resources needed: Will depend on situations you are edealing with 

In start-up situations, your most urgent needs are likely to be adequate financial resources, technical support, and people with the right expertise.
In turnaround situations, you need authority, backed by political support, to make the tough decisions and secure scarce financial and human resources.
In accelerated-growth situations, you need the investment necessary to support growth, as well as support for putting in place needed systems and structures.
In realignment situations, you need consistent, public backing to get the organization to confront the need for change. Ideally, your boss will stand shoulder to shoulder with you, helping pierce through denial and complacency.
In sustaining-success situations, you require financial and technical resources to sustain the core business and exploit promising new opportunities. You also need periodic pushes to set stretch goals that will keep you from drifting into complacency.

1. Identify the resources available to you
	1. Experienced people
	2. New products ready to be launched
	3. Ask yourself: What do I need from my boss
1. Menu approach
	1. Lay out costs and benefits for different levels of resource commitment. 
	2. E.g. if I want my sales to grow X%, I need X%…. 
	3. Going back to ask for more every time is a sure way to loose credibility

### Play or change the game

- In general, playing with the resources of the company and the constraints you have will help you secure more resources 
- In other cases such as turnaround and realignment
	- Need to constantly convince people
	- Have a clear idea in your mind of what you need
	- Associate it with hard data as much as possible. 

### Negotiate for resources

Principles of effective negotiation
1. Focus on underlying interests - what is in it for everyone
2. Look for mutual beneficial exchanges - look for ways to help with their agenda in return for help with yours
3. Link resources to result (do the work that was done before)

## Planning the style conversation

Example: Leaving an important message about an issue, not getting response and then being told that I did not notify the boss - this means the boss is not using this mode of communication. 

- How does the boss like to communicate
- How often
- What kinds of decisions does the boss want to be involved in 
- When can I make the decision on my own

The question is always: How can I manage this difference in working style?

Observe how boss interacts with others
- Is there consistency? 
- If not, why?
- Are there any favourites?
- Prone to micromanagement?
- Come down hard on a few people because of unacceptable performance?

## Scope out dimensions of your box

- When does boss want to have visibility 
- When boss wants to make decisions
- Expect to have a relatively small box at the beginning. 

## Adapt to the boss style
- The relationship with the boss is 100% my responsibility
- Make everything necessary to smooth the relationship
- When in doubt, ask the boss how he would prefer me to proceed. 

## Surface difficult issues

- Address issues as soon as possible
- But build credibility first. 
- Say: I am expected that we will have differences in how we approach issues or decisions but I am committed to achieve the results we agreed. 
- Remind the boss, as much as possible, to focus on the results and not on the methods
- Discuss style issues with someone the boss trust
- Dont address all style issues in a single conversation. 

## Planning the personal development conversation
- Around 90 days
- Discuss how you are doing
- What do you need to improve
- What are you doing well 
- What can you be doing differently
## Working at a Distance
Managing when you are located far from your boss presents a different set of challenges. The risk is greater of falling out of step without realizing it. This puts the onus on you to exert even more discipline over communication, scheduling calls and meetings to be sure you stay aligned.

If it is humanly possible, you should plan to have one or more in-person meetings with your boss early on. It is essential to make face-to-face connections early on to begin to establish a basis of confidence and trust (the same is true if you’re leading a virtual team). So if this means you need to fight for the resources and fly halfway around the world, you should do it.

Think, too, about good ways to carve out time with your boss, who is likely to be busy and buffeted by requests from people who are more physically present than you are. Identify windows of time when your boss is less likely to be completely occupied—for example, during the times when she is traveling to or from the office.

### Putting It All Together: Negotiating Your 90-Day Plan

- Contract between me and the boss
- What I will and will not do 
- After 2 weeks in the job
- It should always be by written
- Divide 90 days in 3 blocks of 30 days
- Have a review with the boss at the end of the first 30 days
- Learning and building credibility in the first 30 days
- Build discipline to do it
- Learning agenda
- Learning plan 
- Weekly goals
- Weekly evaluation and planning 
- End of first 30 days:
	- Diagnosis of the situation
	- Identification of key priorities
	- Plan for how to spend the next 30 days
- Next plan: address where you will seek early wins
	- Situation and expectation conversation 
	- Reaching consensus about the situation
	- Clarify expectations
	- Buy in for the plan of the next 30 days
	- + comtinue wekly discipline of evaluation and planning
- 60 day mark
	- Review progreess towards goals 
	- Plan for next 30 days
	- Identify resources to pursue major initiatives 
	- Flesh out initial assessment of strategy and structure 
	- Present early assessment of the team

### If you are a manager
The golden rule of transitions is to transition others as you would wish to be transitioned yourself (see “The Golden Rule of Transitions”)

1. Introduce the framework to them
2. Schedule a first conversation with them
3. Talk about situation and expectations

The same five-conversation framework can help you build productive relationships with the people who report to you. Introduce the framework to them right away, and schedule a first conversation with each of them to talk about the situation and about your expectations. Get them to do some pre-work before the meeting—for example, reading the chapter on matching strategy to situation.

Table 4-3

## The five conversations and your team
List your team members in the first column. Then assess where you stand in having the five conversations with each one. Circle the ones that are your priorities.


![[Image 2.png]]



### Negotiate success checklist

NEGOTIATE SUCCESS—CHECKLIST

- [ ] How effectively have you built relationships with new bosses in the past? What have you done well? Where do you need improvement?
- [ ] Create a plan for the situational conversation. Based on what you know now, what issues will you raise with your boss in this conversation? What do you want to say up front? In what order do you want to raise issues?
- [ ] Create a plan for the expectations conversation. How will you figure out what your new boss expects you to do?
- [ ] Create a plan for the style conversation. How will you figure out how best to work with your boss? What mode of communication does he prefer? How often should you interact? How much detail should you provide? What types of issues should you consult with him about before deciding?
- [ ] Create a plan for the resource conversation. Given what you need to do, what resources are absolutely needed? With fewer resources, what would you have to forgo? If you had more resources, what would the benefits be? Be sure to build the business case.
- [ ] Create a plan for the personal development conversation. What are your strengths, and where do you need improvement? What kinds of assignments or projects might help you develop skills you need?
- [ ] How might you use the five conversations framework to accelerate the development of your team? Where are you in terms of having the key conversations with each of your direct reports?


## Secure early wins
- Elena succeeded in quickly creating momentum and building personal credibility by securing early wins. 1
- By the end of the first few months, you want your boss, your peers, and your subordinates to feel that something new, something good, is happening

### Making waves
1. Learning 
2. Early wave of changes
3. Slowed down pace to allow for consolidation and learning in the org and to allow people to catch their breath
4. Then, deeper waves of changes
5. Final less extreme wave: fine tuning to optimise performance

Waves if change


![[Image 3.png]]




Plan Your Waves
- Each wave should have distinct phases
- Learning 
- Designing changes 
- Building support
- Implementing changes
- Observing results
- Thunk about breaks
- Unending changes can burn out everyone

### 1 st wave
- Goal: secure early wins
- Build personal credibility
- Establish relationships
- Identify and harvest low hanging fruits
- The highest-potential opportunities for short-term improvements in organizational performance. 

### 2 nd wave
- Strategy
- Structure
- Systems
- Skills
- Reshape the organisation 

### Start with the goal
- Do not fall in the low hanging fruit trap
- Low hanging fruits only will secure early wins but not long term business objectives

- Early wins: double duty of  build momentum in short term and layout foundations for the long term
- Make sure early wins are consistent with long term goals

### Focus on business priorities
- Goals defined with manager should be aligned with business priorities


**Identify and support behavior change**
1. **Identify unwanted behaviors.** 
2. **Work out a clear vision of how you would like people to behave by the end of the job.** 
3. **Plan how actions will advance the process.** 
4. **What behaviors people consistently display thst undermine the potential for high performance**
Use the following table to diagnose the problems. 

![[Image 4.png]]

**Adopt basic principles**

1. **Avoid early losses.** 
2. **Focus on a few promising opportunities only. Do not hope to achieve results in more than a couple atras during the transition.** 
3. **Identify the most promising opportunities and turn them into wins.** 
4. **Pursue enough focal points to have a good shot at getting significant success, but not too much to have the efforts diffused.** 
5. **Get the wins that matter to the boss first.** 
6. **Get wins in the right way. For instance, a win that is obtained through a behavior you want to examplify is a double win.** 
7. **Take the stars portfolio into account. Think about what will build momentum best in each part of the portfolio.** 
8. **Be aware of what is considered a win in the organization, depending for instance on the culture (is winning alone a good thing)**

Identifying early wins
- Think in 2 phases. 
- Building personal credibility in the first 30 days
- Deciding which projects you will launch to achieve performance beyond that. 

**Confirmation bias and understanding the reputation**
- **People will build a reputation of you before**
- **When you arrive they will focus on believing anything that confirms this belief.** 
- **Need to figure out what role people are expecting me to play**
- **Then decide if you will confirm it or confound it**

**Leading former peers**
- Relationships must change
- Close personal relationships are rarely compatible witheffective ones
- Focus on rites of passage
- Reenlist good former peers
- Establish the authority deflty
- Focus on doing what is right for the business


### Building credibility
- In the first weeks of the job, you cannot hope to have a measurable impact on performance
- Possible to score small victories and signal that things are changing

Your credibility, or lack of it, will depend on how people would answer the following questions about you:

- Do you have the insight and steadiness to make tough decisions?
- Do you have values that they relate to, admire, and want to emulate?
- Do you have the right kind of energy?
- Do you demand high levels of performance from yourself and others?

How to build personal credibility:
- It is about marketing yourself effectively
- Similar to building equity in a brand

Common characteristics of effective leaders:
- Demanding but able to be satisfied
- Accessible but not too familiar 
- Decisive but judicious: rapidly makinglow-consequence decisions without jumping too quickly on decisions people are not ready to make. Project decisiveness but defer decisions until you know enough
 - E focused but flexible. Do not appear as rigid to others. Consider multiple solutions. 
- Consult others to consider all possible solutions. 
- Give flexibility to people to achieve results in their own ways. 
- Make things happen but do not push people to the point of burnout
- Making tough calls but staying humane
- Make tough calls right away including letting go of under performers
- People not only watch what you do but also how you do it
- Think about how you will be connected to your organisation in your first days in your new role. 
- Think about the message you want to get through to the company and what are the best ways to convey these messages
- Identify key audiences (direct reports and others) and craft message dedicated to each
- While making progress, remove minor but persistent irritants. Cut redundant meetjngs, shorten excessive long ones
- Improve problems with physical work spaces
- Learning builds credibility
- Shift learning from decision to action
- Actions during first weeks will have a disproportionate impact
- Example:
	- Taking the time to introduce to support staff
- 3-4 key areas to achieve improvement.
