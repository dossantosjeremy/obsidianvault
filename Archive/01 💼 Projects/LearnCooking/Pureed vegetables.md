Puréed Vegetables
Makes: 4 servings | Time: 40 minutes
 
Puréed vegetables are luxurious, delicious, and simple. Root vegetables are best for puréeing since their starchiness lends a creamy texture, but almost anything can work, especially with enough fat. See the chart that follows for many more ideas.
Warm vegetable purées make an elegant bed for simply cooked fish, poultry, or meat. And at room temperature or chilled, they are excellent impromptu dips and spreads.
About 1½ pounds vegetables, one kind or a combination (see the chart on page 241)
Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons olive oil or butter, or more to taste
Chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)

Peel and trim the vegetables as necessary; cut them into roughly equal-sized pieces, 1 to 2 inches in diameter. Put the vegetables in a large pot with water to cover and add a large pinch of salt; or rig a steamer (see page 20) and put the vegetables in it above water. Bring to a boil and cook until the vegetables are tender, usually 5 to 15 minutes. You want the vegetables fully tender but not mushy.
Drain the vegetables well, reserving some of the cooking liquid. (At this point, you can refrigerate the vegetables, well wrapped or in a covered container, for up to 2 days before proceeding.) Cool the vegetables slightly and put them in a blender or food processor with as much of the cooking liquid as you need to get the machine going; purée until as smooth as you like. (You can also mash the vegetables with a large fork or potato masher or run them through a food mill set over a large bowl, adding the cooking liquid as needed.)
Add the oil or butter, and stir, then taste and adjust the seasoning, adding some pepper. Serve, keep warm, or cool and refrigerate for up to a day or 2; reheat them gently on the stove or in the microwave. Garnish with parsley before serving.
