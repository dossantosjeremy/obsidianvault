Roasting Vegetables
The dry heat of roasting in a hot oven intensifies the flavor of vegetables by driving out their internal water. Depending on the vegetable, the results range from slightly chewy to completely tender on the inside and crisped on the outside, with good color. Roasting is a fine method for entertaining, because the results can be served right out of the oven or at room temperature.

Makes: 4 servings | Time: About 1 hour
 
Something magical happens when vegetables are roasted: Their flavors concentrate, the texture becomes soft and a bit chewy, and the outside turns a beautiful golden brown, and sometimes charred in places. Just remember to give the pieces a little breathing room in the pan; they’ll shrink a bit but not much. You can always divide the vegetables between two or more pans, or roast in batches.
Seasoning with simple salt and pepper is fine. For more ideas, see the chart on page 248. The best time to add spices is during the last couple of minutes of cooking; fresh herbs should be tossed into the pan after the vegetables are out of the oven.
Vegetables and fruits you can use: apples, artichoke hearts (fresh, not canned; see page 258), asparagus, Brussels sprouts, carrots, cauliflower, celery root, eggplant (use extra oil), fennel, grapes, leeks, okra (trimmed but whole), onions, parsnips, potatoes, radishes, shallots (whole), summer or winter squash, sweet potatoes, yams, turnips, or rutabaga.
3 tablespoons olive oil, melted butter, or a mixture, plus more as needed
1½ to 2 pounds vegetables (one kind or a combination with similar cooking times), peeled, trimmed, seeded, and chopped or sliced as needed
Salt and pepper

Heat the oven to 425°F while you prepare the vegetables. Drizzle half the oil on a roasting pan or baking sheet. Add the vegetables and drizzle with the remaining oil; sprinkle with salt and pepper. Stir, or if roasting vegetables that will fall apart with stirring like fennel, leeks, or onion slices, use a pastry brush to coat them with the oil.
Roast the vegetables undisturbed until they release easily from the pan, 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the sturdiness of the vegetable; then stir or toss with a spatula.
Continue roasting, stirring once or twice more, until the vegetables are tender and browned in places, another 10 to 50 minutes, again depending on the vegetable. If they’re starting to burn, lower the temperature to 400°F and stir more frequently. Taste and adjust the seasoning. Serve hot or at room temperature.
