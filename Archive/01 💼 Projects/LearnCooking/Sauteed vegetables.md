Sautéing Vegetables
I wish there were another word for sautéing, since it sounds much more intimidating than it is: nothing more than cooking food quickly in hot fat. Stir-frying is a subset of sautéing; see the following section. (And for more information on both, see pages 17 and 20 in Cooking Basics.)
The only potential downside is that you must check the vegetables frequently while sautéing and anticipate doneness, since they’ll continue to cook even off the heat. The recipe that follows walks you through the process so you get the hang of what to look for. If you’re comfortable boiling or steaming (or microwaving) vegetables—or want to prepare them in advance to finish easily at the last minute, then try the variation.


Sautéed Vegetables
Makes: 4 servings | Time: 5 minutes
 
The secret ingredient to perfect sautéed vegetables is often a little water. It’s especially helpful if you’re cooking hard vegetables like winter squashes.
2 tablespoons butter or olive oil, or more as needed
1 to 2 pounds the vegetable of your choice, peeled, stemmed, seeded, and/or chopped as needed
Salt
Pepper (optional)

Put the butter or oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the butter foams or the oil is hot, add the vegetables and sprinkle with salt, and with pepper if you like.
Adjust the heat so the vegetables sizzle without burning, and cook, stirring occasionally, until their color turns vibrant, about 2 minutes.
Start tasting one of the smallest pieces. Quick-cooking vegetables like greens and snow peas might be tender. Sturdy vegetables and anything in between will require anywhere from a few minutes to 10 or 15 minutes more; adding water, 1 tablespoon at a time, helps prevent the vegetables from browning and can speed up cooking by creating steam. When the vegetables are just a little less tender than you ultimately want them, remove the pan from the heat, add a little more butter or oil if you like, taste and adjust the seasoning, and serve.

Parboiled or Steamed Vegetables in Butter or Oil With a two-step process, you can cook vegetables perfectly at the last minute: Follow the recipe for boiling or steaming the vegetable of your choice on page 238, or see “Microwaving Vegetables” on page 237; make sure you cook it a little less tender than you ultimately want them. Shock the vegetables if you like (see page 238), and after draining, cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day. When you’re ready to eat, follow the recipe above, but in Step 2 cook them just long enough to heat through, no more than a minute or 2.
