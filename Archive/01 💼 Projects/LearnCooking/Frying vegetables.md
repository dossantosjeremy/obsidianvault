Frying Vegetables
Messy, and you need a lot fat, but frying is popular for a reason, right? Whether you coat the vegetables or not, you can pan-fry them in shallow oil (½ inch deep or so) or deep-fry in enough oil to submerge them (2 to 3 inches oil in a large pot).
To pan-fry Put a large skillet over medium to medium-high heat and add the oil. It should be hot but not smoking before you add the vegetables (test a small piece first; the vegetable should sizzle immediately and vigorously). See Breaded and Fried Eggplant (or Any Other Vegetable) on page 288 for cutlets or flat slices cooked this way.
To deep-fry The oil should maintain a temperature between 350°F and 375°F, depending on the recipe (see “Deep-Frying,” page 22). Be careful to allow enough room to add the vegetables without the oil overflowing. Work in small batches so the vegetables can properly crisp. The recipe that follows is a solid start; this method is actually pretty fast and easy.

Battered and Fried Vegetables
Makes: 4 servings | Time: 30 minutes
 
There are lots of ways to batter and deep-fry vegetables, but this is the most basic. You can use zucchini, eggplant, winter squash, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus tips, onion rings, fennel, beets, or carrots. Hard vegetables like potatoes should be sliced no more than ½ inch thick. Small or thin vegetables like mushrooms or green beans should be left whole. These are great served with a dipping sauce. Or finish with kosher or sea salt and lemon wedges for last-minute squeezing.
2 cups all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
Salt and pepper
1 egg
¾ cup beer or sparkling water
Good-quality vegetable oil for frying
1½ to 2 pounds vegetables, prepared as described above

 Mix 1 cup of the flour with the baking powder. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Whisk in the egg and beer until just combined and the consistency of pancake batter. It’s okay to have some lumps in the batter; you don’t want to overmix. Put the remaining 1 cup flour in a shallow bowl or plate. Prepare all the vegetables as necessary and have them near the flour and batter. Line a baking sheet with towels or fit it with a wire rack.
Put at least 2 inches oil in a large pot over medium-high heat; bring to 350°F (see “Deep-Frying,” page 22). Keep an eye on the temperature of the oil.
When the oil is ready, dredge one piece of food at a time lightly in the flour, dip into the batter to coat, and add to the oil. Don’t crowd the vegetables; be prepared to work in batches. Cook, turning once if needed, until golden all over, 3 to 7 minutes. As the pieces finish transfer them to the prepared pan to drain. Sprinkle with more salt and additional pepper if you like, and serve right away.
