Stir-Frying Vegetables
Like sautéing, stir-frying is a stovetop technique that uses a little bit of fat in a broad-bottomed pan to cook all kinds of vegetables quickly. There are a couple differences: With stir-frying you might choose to brown and sear the food before it has chance to overcook, and usually you make some kind of sauce in the pan simultaneously, or afterwards. And this method is versatile enough to cook multiple vegetables or add meat or other protein to get an entire meal on the table fast. For more detail on stir-frying, see page 20. Here are the basic points to get you started:

The smaller you cut the food, the faster it will cook. That means grated vegetables like potatoes, beets, or squash can be stir-fried in several minutes.
The list that follows outlines lots of options, but too many ingredients can crowd the pan, slow you down, and lead to overcooking and muddled flavors.
Use the largest flat-bottomed skillet you have; stainless steel or well-seasoned cast iron is best, and high heat is essential. A wok is only good if you have a special deep burner designed to let gas flames lap up the sides.
Stir almost constantly unless you want to promote searing and browning, in which case stir less frequently.
For large pieces or vegetables that take a longer time to cook, you have three options: Parboil until tender and shock them; cut them small; or grate them.
It’s counterintuitive, but stir-frying in batches is faster than trying to overcrowd the pan, and the results are always superior. In the case of longer-cooking vegetables, you can stir-fry them first; using a little water or other liquid to create steam will speed things up. Transfer them to a plate, then add more fat and the quicker-cooking vegetables, or even meat. Repeat as necessary, then return everything to the pan to season and reheat.
A little liquid is always valuable in stir-fries, whether it’s water or something with more flavor like wine, stock, soy sauce, or fish sauce. It encourages vegetables to cook more quickly (see above and Sautéed Vegetables on page 242); at the end, liquid will keep ingredients from burning and will create a sauce.
