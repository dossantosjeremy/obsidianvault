Broiled Vegetable Gratin
Makes: 4 servings | Time: 15 minutes with cooked vegetables
 
Using this broiler method, vegetable gratins are more about assembly than cooking. Start with boiled, steamed, roasted, grilled, or even sautéed vegetables; if needed, slice them, cut into wedges, or chop into bite-size chunks. Add a simple topping, and the results are easy and elegant. For something more involved, see the variation and the chart on page 256.
2 tablespoons olive oil or butter, plus more for greasing the pan
4 to 6 cups any cooked vegetable (1½ to 2 pounds raw), sliced or chopped as desired
1 cup grated Parmesan cheese
½ cup bread crumbs (preferably fresh; see page 801)
Salt and pepper

Turn on the broiler and position the rack about 4 inches below the heat. Grease a broad, shallow flameproof baking dish, or a rimmed baking sheet. Put the vegetables in the prepared dish, spreading them out a bit into an even layer. Sprinkle with salt and pepper if they’re not already seasoned. Distribute the cheese and bread crumbs over all. Drizzle with the oil or dot with bits of butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper.
Put the vegetables under the broiler and cook until the topping is golden brown, hot, and bubbly, which could be as little as 2 minutes but certainly no more than 10. Keep a close watch so it doesn’t burn. Serve.

Richer Broiled Vegetable Gratin Use only enough butter or oil to grease the baking dish. Instead of the Parmesan make a recipe of Béchamel (page 79) and grate 1 cup Gruyère or other Swiss melting cheese. After spreading the vegetables into the prepared dish, cover the top with the sauce, then the cheese and breadcrumbs. Broil as directed and garnish with chopped parsley or chives if you’d like.
