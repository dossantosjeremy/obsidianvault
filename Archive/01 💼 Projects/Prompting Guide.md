First, find the quotes from the document that are most relevant to answering the question, and then print them in numbered order. Quotes should be relatively short.

If there are no relevant quotes, write “No relevant quotes” instead.

Then, answer the question, starting with “Answer:“. Do not include or reference quoted content verbatim in the answer. Don’t say “According to Quote [1]” when answering. Instead make references to quotes relevant to each section of the answer solely by adding their bracketed numbers at the end of relevant sentences.

Thus, the format of your overall response should look like what’s shown between the tags. Make sure to follow the formatting and spacing exactly.
Quotes:
[1] “Company X reported revenue of $12 million in 2021.”
