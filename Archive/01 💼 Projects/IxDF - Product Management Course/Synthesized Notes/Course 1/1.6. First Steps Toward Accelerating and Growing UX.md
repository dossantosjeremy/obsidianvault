# Where to begin? 
1. The first thing is to fix the pain points. Find things that are problematic for our users. Coordinate things for fixing. Fix low handing fruits with usabilty testing. 
2. Elevate. Sharing the fruits of the repairs. Measure and incentivize the rewards for that. Taking best practices... UI Style guide for instance. 
3. Starting optimizing. Use toolkits. E.g. a user-centered toolkit, UI Pattern library. 
   Have a set of user requirements, validate them. Build a process. 
   That is one of the weak point. Sharpening the UX Process. 
   Sharpen the sensitivity. Optimizing the UX Process. 
4. Differentiation: UX Metrics across the whole journey. Map, step back and look at what is broken from a user perspective journey. Mapping the user journey and see where are main pains. 

# How to do it
