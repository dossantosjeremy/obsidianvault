* UX In essence is political because it is the act of bringing the point of view of your users into the design. 
* The core job of a UX Researcher is advocacy. 
* Why is it so important to advocate and to do UX Research. If you do not, how would you know what are users' pain points, what do they event want?
* This requires to spend time with them (1 hour for instance is a pretty standard time)
* Margaret Mead: What people say and what they do is radically different. What they think they do is different from what they do. So there is a need to run user research.
* User research is different from market research, in market research you have what people say. 
* The amount of time you spend with your users is proportional to the quality of your product (Jared Spool)
* Doing UX Research with people in house is not per se good UX. It is a hack. It can be done in between, as Google does it with cafeteria testing, but you need real users. 
* Remember to video or record the users because then you can share snippets of them to the organization and that helps with empathy. 
* It is important that stakeholders are involved from the beginning at least in the interviews and if they are not able to be involved, at least in a findings meeting. 
* **Average duration of a findings meeting: 60 to 120 minutes. Also produce a highlight reel, that way you will not take too much of their time.** 
* Invite management to meetings with users, after all they are the clients. 
* Ask management what time suits them best to schedule the calls. 
* Schedule the calls at least 3 weeks in advance 
* Rarely we have UX and Business being balanced. They are oftentimes out of balance. It is the role of the UX Researcher to keeep them balanced. This is accomplished thanks to the design thinking process and a UX culture. We also need metrics to make objective decisions about the product and the user. 
* We need to be outside in instead of inside out. 
* IBM changed the name of their UCD lab to outside in design group. Outside in is an attitude. It is like saying we are empathetic. 
* UX brings
	* New ideas: New markets, new products, new features
	* New insights: customer research and lowering the risk
	* New directions: quick prototypes, UI/UX, visual design...


* To get feedback, we can use usability testing. It is not a focus group, it is about actually asking users. 
* We can also use heuristic analysis and expert review. 
* We can also use rapid prototyping with wireframe and low-fidelity prototype. 
* What will really help us differentiate and innovate are tests and user research done without the need for a product. 
* Also, when designing, it should be done without having the constraints in mind, at least at first in order to get some bluesky thinking. 

* UCD is about running research, prototyping and testing and refining. 

**Daily activities
* Syncing with development team regularly to get to know the constraints, providing updates... 
* Preparing reports or UX Research
* Conducting Expert reviews, not the same because not with users but it is a fast and cheap methodology

Monthly activity
- Doing some research
- Crafting the designs
- Instauring a culture of wireframing as this is something everybody can do (e.g. at Capital One)


A lot of companies have to do UX without being able / not being allowed to interact with users. This is essential to create empathy and to have a user centered design.
