Podcasts are an exciting medium to share ideas, opinions, and those intimate conversations you always thought more people should be a part of. While it might seem intimidating for beginners, learning how to start your own podcast can be a breeze, especially if you have an easy-to-follow guide covering everything you need to know about making a podcast.

‍

This handbook will help you tackle all the variables involved in starting your first podcast from the ground up. Feel free to bookmark this article and use it as a directory to refer back to when you want to read up more on a specific element of the podcasting process.

‍

## The basics

Before jumping into this tutorial, let’s start by covering the basics and getting you up to speed with Spotify for Podcasters.

‍

### What is a podcast?

Let’s be real. Most of us have a general understanding of what a podcast is (a collection of digital audio or video files that are made available for audiences), but as we enter the podcast world ourselves, more questions start popping up. 

‍

A podcast can be many different things—and it all depends on you, the creator. A podcast can be:   
‍

-   One person speaking into a microphone (or even their phone’s mic) alone in their apartment or podcast studio
-   A pair of friends or a group of five
-   It can be serious, funny, boisterous, cerebral, quirky, sarcastic, or a little bit of everything. 

But in its simplest form, a podcast needs two things: an idea, and a voice to bring it to life. Plus, now that video podcasts on Spotify are available to [**more creators than ever**](https://podcasters.spotify.com/features/video), the answer to “what is a podcast?” has expanded even further.

‍

#### What is a video podcast, and should I try making one?

[Video podcasts on Spotify](https://podcasters.spotify.com/features/video) bring the mediums of video and audio together in perfect harmony. Where available, this feature allows current video creators (or audio-only podcasters!) to expand their reach to new fans on Spotify, and deepen their connections with current fans. [It’s as easy as uploading a video file via Spotify for Podcasters, and it gets published right to Spotify](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/how-to-start-a-video-podcast-on-spotify)—then your audience can choose to watch or listen in the background, so they can enjoy your episodes wherever they go.

‍

### Why should I start a podcast?

[**Every voice is a podcast voice**](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/your-voice-is-a-podcast-voice)—and yes, that includes yours. Whether you want to use your voice to create, express, or build, podcasting is the perfect way to say it all. It also helps that podcasting continues to grow as a medium: More people than ever are creating audio (and now video) stories. Even if you already have a fan base from a different hustle, podcasting can help you expand your reach and connect with your audience in a deeper, more authentic way. 

‍

### What is Spotify for Podcasters?

Spotify for Podcasters is a free platform that helps creators distribute, grow, and monetize their show — all from our app or website. Get powerful tools to connect directly with fans, understand how your podcast gets discovered, and stand out on the world’s most popular listening platform.

‍

If you already have a podcast hosted elsewhere, you can still take advantage of Spotify's free growth tools for podcasters, like analytics and fan engagement. You can do this by claiming your show on Spotify for Podcasters. Claiming your show does not change ownership over your content or off-platform management.

So go ahead, focus on your content and we’ll take care of the rest. 

‍

## What do you need to start a podcast?

The good news is, starting a podcast is not as complex as you might think. All you need to do is nail down a couple of foundational elements, and you’ll be ready to get your show on the road. 

‍

Check out some quick tips in our video, and dive deeper below:

‍

### Choose a podcast topic

Picking a podcast topic requires you to look inward and answer a simple question: What do you love to talk about? One way to answer this question is to think about when you’re the most happy, fulfilled, or excited—and use that as a jumping-off point. You could even think about what podcasts you currently enjoy listening to, and use those for inspiration. It might also help to think about a podcast topic broad enough to cover many episodes, or perhaps even multiple seasons.

‍

Here are a couple of podcast ideas to get your wheels turning on a podcast topic if you’re not sure where to begin:  
‍

-   Check out our article featuring [podcast topic advice](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-topics) from four experienced creators and let them guide your initial process
-   Look for [trending podcast topics](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/trending-podcast-topics) within your broader areas of interest. This will help you produce relevant and timely content while also providing inspiration when you’re experiencing a creative dry spell (it happens to all of us!).   

### Determine a podcast format

There are several podcast formats to choose from, and it’s important to pick the right one for you. Ask yourself the following: Do I see myself [podcasting solo](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/solo-podcast-ideas), or with one or maybe more friends or co-hosts? Do I want to interview guests with expertise in specific areas? Do I want to talk about reality, or make up a fantastical world of my own?   
‍

All of these things are worth considering, but you can dive even deeper with our [complete guide to podcast formats](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-formats). And if you’re rolling the cameras, there are plenty of ways to [get inspired for a unique video podcast](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/video-podcast-examples), too. 

‍

### Consider your podcast audience and how you’ll reach them

Defining your ideal audience is the first step in the journey toward building a loyal base of listeners who’ll engage with you and your show. Consider:  
‍

1.  Your niche
2.  The kinds of people who would be interested in consuming content about it
3.  How you can best reach them.

For an in-depth guide about the early stages of finding potential listeners, check out our resource on [how to discover your podcast target audience](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/podcast-target-audience).  
‍

Keep in mind that no matter who you are, your podcast audience will start off small, and that’s okay. Every successful podcast had to start somewhere. It’s important to begin with simple goals in mind—things like getting to know yourself as a creator, getting to know your listeners, and connecting with them through avenues on social media, like [TikTok](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/tiktok-podcast-promotion) or Instagram. What feels like little steps will lead to big accomplishments, like [getting your first 100 listeners](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/start-podcast-no-audience). 

‍

## How to choose your podcast equipment

You can use your computer to record solo, or bring in your favorite guests to record audio or video interviews right on our Spotify for Podcasters website through our new integration with [Riverside](https://support.spotify.com/us/podcasters/article/creating-with-riverside-fm/) - an excellent platform that offers powerful, AI-driven recording and editing tools used by creators of all sizes.

‍

However, there’s also a wide variety of podcast microphones (from XLR to USB microphones) available to enhance your audio recording setup and improve audio quality. If you’re interested in exploring podcast tech beyond your phone, head out to our complete [podcast equipment guide](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/podcast-equipment-guide) for creators, where we touch on everything from recording software to pop filters and cables. Curious to know how you can elevate the recording environment even further? Read our guide on how to set up your [podcast studio](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-studio-setup) for the best results.

‍

## How to develop your podcast branding

You are unique, and so is your podcast. And the way you convey that unique identity to your listeners is through [podcast branding](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-branding). From your podcast cover art to your podcast description, intro theme, and even your [podcast trailer](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/why-your-podcast-needs-a-trailer), every element associated with your podcast comes together to establish the tone and character of your show. The visual and audio identity these elements express are what sets your podcast apart and makes it top of mind for listeners.

‍

### Choose a podcast name

Naming your podcast can be a tricky thing, but luckily we've put together a resource on [how to choose a great podcast name](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-name) to make it easier. Your podcast’s name has the potential to make your show exponentially more memorable and appealing—or not. 

‍

Pro-tip: you don’t actually need to add the word “podcast”. Here are a couple of [podcast name ideas](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-name-ideas) to help you nail this aspect of your podcast identity.

‍

### Create a signature podcast intro and outro

Both your podcast intro and outro are key elements of your podcast. A standout podcast intro is your chance to make a great first impression and hook listeners enough that they stick around until the end (and come back for future episodes!). A memorable outro is how you end a podcast on a high note and keep listeners engaged and connected.

‍

Intros and outros are also uniquely your own. They’re a chance to reinforce your identity, your topic, your name, and encourage your audience to do something that will help your show grow. You can accomplish the latter through calls-to-action (CTAs)— for example, asking listeners to rate your show, participate in Q&As and polls, follow your social media accounts, or tell their friends and family about your podcast. Just make sure you stick to one CTA so you don’t overwhelm the audience with too many options and they end up doing nothing.

‍

## How to make  a podcast episode

The process of creating a podcast episode begins *before* you hit record and ends long after you step away from the microphone. From scripting all the way to editing, here are the key steps to put together a podcast episode you’ll be proud of.

‍

### Pre-production

Nothing wrong with winging an episode, especially if inspiration strikes at a random moment! But a surefire way to both keep your podcast consistent and maintain your quality standards is to stay one step ahead. Use the pre-production stage to plan. Think about:  
‍

-   The topics you want to discuss
-   The guests you want to interview
-   What a new potential listener might want to hear. 

A [podcast schedule](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-schedule) can help you stay on top of your tasks and manage your [podcast workflow](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-workflow) to the best of your ability. Using a podcast planning template during pre-production is also a great strategy to anticipate tasks that need to be completed and when, like [writing an episode script](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/how-to-write-podcast-scripts) or reaching out to potential guests.

‍

If you do plan on having a guest, it’s a good idea to brainstorm a few questions before recording. But as our [article on writing great interview questions](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-interview-questions) points out, it’s a balancing act: a combination of being prepared but flexible at the same time. Once you’re sitting with a guest recording an episode, anything could happen. As a podcast host, your ability to switch gears is crucial. But of course, there are ways to increase your chances of an A-plus interview, like asking open-ended questions, following up on interesting points, and doing your research beforehand. 

‍

### Podcast recording

You’ve done your planning, and now you’re ready for the next step. When you’re thinking about podcast recording, the location might not be the first thing you consider, but it can make or break your episode. People record from so many different places—the living room, bedroom (or bed), the closet, the at-home studio—but sound quality is important. 

‍

Try creating an acoustically-friendly environment free of background noise, echoes and other distractions. If you find yourself in a bind, [Spotify for Podcasters’ Audio Enhancement](https://podcasters.spotify.com/features/create) tool can erase noise and improve your recording, even in noisier places like a coffee shop or the back of a car. And if you’re making a [video podcast](https://podcasters.spotify.com/features/video), be sure to consider your [visual setup](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/how-to-record-a-video-podcast) as well.

Before you start recording your first episode, pause and make sure you’re set up for success:

1.  Is your recording equipment ready? 
2.  Are your devices charged?
3.  Is your script or outline where you can see it? 
4.  How is your Wi-Fi connection? 
5.  If you have guests you’ll interview remotely, are they ready with a quiet space to record and good WiFi signal, too? 
6.  If you’re filming a video podcast, are your lights and cameras placed correctly? 

Take a moment to consider the details, then take the most important step of all: press record. 

‍

### Podcast editing and post-production

Once your episode is recorded, then it’s time to edit. Podcast audio editing can be a challenge for many new podcasters who aren’t familiar or experienced with podcast editing software.  There are certainly better ways to edit than others. That’s why [we chatted with two Spotify producers to explain the most important editing dos and don’ts](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-editing-guide). They cover topics like goal-oriented editing, assembling your tools, and creative audio storytelling. Making a video podcast? We’ve got you covered with [video-specific editing tips](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/video-podcast-editing). 

‍

At the editing stage, you can add extra audio files to your episodes to make them pop and elevate the listening experience, like sound effects and music.

‍

Post-production is also when you put the finishing touches on each episode’s branding—namely, the episode title, podcast artwork (though episode-specific artwork isn’t required, rather a nice to have), and description. For the latter, start by thinking about the essence of your episode: what keywords come to mind? These could be certain words that jump off the page and grab your attention, or they could be specifics like topics or guest names. This advice and much more—like episode length, optimization, and consistency—can be found in our article about writing the perfect [podcast episode description](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcast-episode-descriptions). 

‍

## How to distribute your podcast

Now that you have your first batch of episodes ready, it’s time to share them with the world. 

‍

An essential first step is publishing your podcast to Spotify and the many other podcast directories where people tune in to their favorite shows . You distribute your podcast via your podcast hosting service, the place where your podcast audio and information lives. Most hosting sites generate something called a podcast RSS feed. A feed functions like your podcast’s unique ID, and is what you use to share your podcast on other directories. 

‍

Every podcast episode created with Spotify for Podcasters is automatically published to Spotify, which currently has over [100 million podcast listeners](https://newsroom.spotify.com/2023-06-05/an-update-on-changes-to-spotifys-podcast-business-june-2023/). Your show will also appear on every major podcast hosting platform as well, if you choose to distribute elsewhere. 

‍

## How to promote your show with great podcast marketing

Promotion isn’t an afterthought. Things like capturing behind-the-scenes content and pinpointing the best clips to repurpose should be integrated with the overall creation process. This will make it a lot easier to get the marketing wheels turning when it’s time to promote a specific episode. 

‍

Having [social accounts dedicated to promoting your podcast](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/how-to-promote-podcast-social-media) is maybe the easiest and most accessible way to market your show—and don’t forget to cross-promote on your personal accounts as well. However, there are other ways to gain traction, including:   
‍

-   Creating a [podcast newsletter](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/podcast-newsletter)
-   Scoring press coverage [(here’s a straightforward guide to pitching your podcast](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/how-to-pitch-a-podcast), both to the press and beyond)
-   Leveraging word of mouth (you never know who might be listening, so go ahead and spread the word)
-   Taking advantage of outlets to network with other podcasters and finding promotion opportunities.

Connecting with other creators has become easier with the help of Spotify for Podcasters’ [Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/269662786903674). Other ways to network and get new eyes and ears on your podcast could be [appearing as a guest on someone else’s show](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/podcast-cross-promotion), or doing a crossover episode with another podcaster. 

‍

## How to grow your podcast 

Believe it or not, publication and marketing aren’t the end of your podcast journey. With Spotify for Podcasters’ innovative tools and support on your side, each episode is a new opportunity to grow your audience, promote your show, and even monetize your podcast content (more on that later). 

‍

There’s [a fully comprehensive guide to gaining momentum with your podcast growth](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/grow-audience) right on our Resource hub—covering topics like tracking your ratings, finding new global podcast listeners using analytics, and taking advantage of interactivity tools. Read on to learn more about how you can keep growing your podcast once you get a hang of the essentials.

‍

### Optimize your podcast for growth

If you want to increase your chances of more fans finding you, then you need to prime your podcast for discovery. Start by [optimizing your Spotify show page](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/how-to-use-spotifys-listening-features-to-grow-your-show) to get the attention of the millions of listeners who get their podcasting needs met by Spotify. You’ll also want to pay attention to your [podcast SEO](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/podcast-seo). The words you use in your podcast title, episode descriptions, show notes, podcast website, and more, play a significant role in how easy it is for listeners to find your podcast in directories and search engines.

‍

### Find ways to boost audience engagement

As you grow your show, you’ll want to develop a deeper connection with fans and really work towards building and [retaining a loyal audience](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/podcast-engagement-strategies). Spotify for Podcasters has launched a number of in-app features that make engaging your fans feel as natural as talking to a friend. Among our favorite features to increase [audience engagement](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/audience-engagement) are [Q&A and polls](https://podcasters.spotify.com/features/grow), which let you ask your fans questions and add them to any episode, allowing responses directly in the Spotify app.

‍

Of course, creators are always encouraged to interact with their fans through social media in their own distinct voice and style. All of this helps listeners feel even closer to the content they already love.

‍

### Leverage analytics to measure success

You’re making an effort to promote your podcast and keep your audience engaged, but how do you know whether what you’re doing is actually working? At the end of the day, how do you [measure podcast success](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/how-to-measure-podcast-success)?

‍

First, it’s important to define what success means for you and your show. New listeners? More subscribers? Increased audience engagement? Once you know what you want to measure and monitor, you can use Spotify for Podcasters’ analytics features to help you [understand your episode performance](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/understanding-your-episode-performance). 

‍

Here’s how to access your podcast analytics:   
‍

1.  Log into your Spotify for Podcasters dashboard.
2.  Head over to Catalog (for non-hosted users) or Analytics (for hosted users). 

You can also view your analytics on your phone or tablet with Spotify for Podcasters’ mobile analytics. [Now that you’re looking at the data, there’s a few helpful ways to use it](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/spotify-podcast-analytics): things like using listener stats (age, gender, location) to inform your content, or using your most popular episodes as inspiration.

‍

### Keep growing your podcast on Spotify

Spotify’s podcast editorial team is always looking for passionate new creators to feature. Put yourself out there by submitting your podcast to the editorial submission form, where up-and-coming shows are featured across one of Spotify’s community destinations or in the New Releases section.

‍

Having a podcast on Spotify is something to brag about, and luckily there’s an easy way to do it: [Promo Cards](https://promocards.byspotify.com/) will generate personalized, Spotify-branded assets for you to share with fans on social. Simply search for your podcast name, choose your favorite color, and use your promo card to spread the word. 

‍

## How to make money podcasting

Have you ever wondered [how creators make money podcasting](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/how-do-podcasts-make-money)? There are multiple ways you might go down that road, both within and outside of Spotify for Podcasters.   
‍

A podcast subscription, for example, is a monetization model where listeners extend a [monthly payment](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/plans-for-podcast-payments) in exchange for [subscriber-only content](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/video-podcast-ideas-for-subscribers-only-show) and other perks. If you’re curious about what that process entails, you can read about how two creators [launched profitable subscriptions](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/launch-profitable-podcast-subscriptions) using Spotify for Podcasters.

‍

Advertising is another popular vehicle for podcast monetization. You can leverage ads for your show through:  
‍

-   **Host-read ads,** where you voice the ad yourself, and infuse your own personality into it (these ads are available on Spotify for Podcasters in certain countries)
-   **Third-party ads,** where you insert sponsor-read advertisements into pre-selected show breaks.

There are other methods available to monetize your show, including listener donations, tipping, and merch. Each of those ways allows you to maintain control of your creative vision, while earning money in the process. Learn more about how you can [monetize your podcast with Spotify.](http://podcasters.spotify.com/features/earn)

‍

## Keep your listeners close

No matter how much you grow, you’ll want to keep your listeners engaged. You can use [Fan Study](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/research/fan-study) or your Podcast Analytics to better understand your fans on Spotify. Seeing your stats is a good reminder that you aren’t just publishing into a void—you’re building a community of real people with every new episode. 

‍

Every podcast creator, no matter who you are, had to start somewhere—overcoming obstacles, uncertainty, and [creative blocks](http://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/podcasters-creative-block) along the way. The truth is, there’s no right or wrong answer when it comes to sharing audio or video stories. But Spotify for Podcasters is here to guide you through starting your podcast, leveling up your creative process, and growing your show. If you ever need further inspiration, our educational [Resources hub](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn) is a great place to start.
