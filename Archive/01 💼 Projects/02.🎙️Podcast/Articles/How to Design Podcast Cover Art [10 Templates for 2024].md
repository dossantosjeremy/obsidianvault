March 05, 2024

Podcast cover art is one of the most important pieces of your podcast's [brand](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/podcast-marketing):

-   it's the first thing potential listeners see in Apple Podcasts, 
-   it signifies the quality of your podcast, and
-   62% of new listeners are more likely to listen if they like its cover art.

Follow this step-by-step guide to create high-quality podcast artwork that will make a great first impression.

## 12 tips to create excellent podcast cover art

### 1\. Make sure it meets Apple Podcasts' requirements

Your cover art must meet Apple Podcasts' artwork [requirements](https://podcasters.apple.com/support/896-artwork-requirements):

-   3000 x 3000 pixels
-   Resolution of 72 dpi
-   JPG or PNG file type
-   RGB colorspace

3000 x 3000 looks massive, but each podcast directory will resize it in their app. Artwork that follows these guidelines will work in all of the [podcast directories](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/podcast-directories).

**Tip:** If you use Photoshop, keep your image at 72 dpi. Programs like Canva will do this automatically.

### 2\. Design for a variety of sizes

Make sure your new podcast artwork looks great everywhere it's displayed:

-   as a small thumbnail in podcast apps,
-   in podcast directories like [Apple Podcasts](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/submit-apple-podcasts) or [Spotify](https://www.buzzsprout.com/blog/submit-podcast-spotify),
-   on large monitors, and
-   as an icon in Apple CarPlay.

### 3\. Clearly communicate the subject of your podcast

Make sure that potential listeners can tell what your podcast episodes are about by looking at your artwork.

Which one of these scenarios best fits your podcast?

#### Podcasts about hobbies

If you are launching a hobbyist podcast, use artwork specific to your hobby.

![Podcast cover art with star wars imagry](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout%2F9af79cdb-8d02-44cd-ab5b-232eeddfe7c3_star+wars.png?auto=compress,format)

For example, a Star Wars podcast should incorporate Star Wars themed images.

Make sure your fellow superfans can easily see what the podcast is about!

#### Podcasts promoting a business, brand, or church

If you are launching a podcast for an existing brand, use your existing logo and brand colors.

![Podcast art with prominent logos](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/788fab3776522169d07feaa66a00f85ff2c74140_church-business.png?auto=compress,format)

Following your existing brand guidelines will help current customers and members recognize your podcast.

#### Personality driven podcasts

Some of the most popular podcasts are personality-driven shows.

![Podcast art featuring famous people](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/ff1a15d85db90cf657201b7b36b8833848caaf91_personalities.png?auto=compress,format)

Consider using a picture of the podcast host in your podcast cover artwork if the show is hosted by a celebrity or well-known person.

### 4\. Limit the number of words in your artwork

A good podcast cover can quickly get overwhelmed with too much text.

Most artwork doesn't have space for the podcast title, tagline, and host's name.

Limit yourself to using a maximum of seven words to ensure legibility.

### 5\. Don't use explicit language or imagery

Your podcast album cover must be censored even if it's labeled as explicit in your RSS Feed.

![blurred artwork](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/57b2ec80-d856-47f0-b548-06e2c6251cac_blurred.png?auto=compress,format)

-   Most podcast apps don't allow nudity
-   Remove references to hard drug use or violence
-   Curse words should be censored in the artwork

**Tip:** If you're unsure if your podcast violates these rules, search Apple Podcasts for similar podcasts to see what is acceptable

### 6\. Use attractive typography

Limit visual distractions and focus on legibility by following these typography best practices.

![](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/a1289a3d-bc73-4884-89a8-7cb1e0cd7480_CleanShot+2024-03-05+at+15.54.46%402x.png?auto=compress,format)

-   Use a maximum of two fonts in your design
-   If you use two fonts, use one serif and one sans-serif font
-   Don't crowd the image with text
-   Make sure it's readable in small sizes
-   Avoid visually distracting lettering like papyrus or comic sans

### 7\. Avoid overused podcasting imagery

Unless your podcast is about the podcast industry, don't use images of microphones and pop filters.

![Microphone podcast logo](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout%2F8413d822-da69-49af-8415-1894d74c3372_podcast-artwork-mic.jpg?auto=compress,format)

Podcasting is the medium you're using—it isn't the subject of your show. Including headphones in your artwork is like putting pictures of DVDs and cameras on a movie poster.

### 8\. Use consistent branding

Apple, Coca-Cola, and Nike are all masters at branding because they use consistent imagery across all their platforms.

![Consistent branding of the Nike podcast logo ](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout%2F0a5874b8-d1d9-4bc0-8416-1df6167acd13_podcast-artwork-nike.jpg?auto=compress,format)

Use the same colors, fonts, and images in your podcast artwork that you use on your website and on social media.

### 9\. Use high-resolution images

Make sure your podcast artwork looks great by using high-resolution images.

![](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/d6912b38-afe4-46c1-bdfb-38d15df5f256_CleanShot+2024-03-05+at+14.42.02%402x.png?auto=compress,format)

If you use high-quality stock photos from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/) or [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com/) then they'll be large enough to not look pixelated on any devices.

### 10\. Use color selection to your advantage

If you're creating a new brand with your podcast, you can be intentional about the colors you pick.

![](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/2fa48978-10a3-432c-81c5-ef75ca0889b4_CleanShot+2024-03-05+at+14.22.23%402x.png?auto=compress,format)

Contrasting colors are more eye-catching and attract potential listeners.

Look through the color palettes on [Canva](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palette-generator/) and [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/tags/color_palette) for inspiration.

### 11\. Compress your final image

High-resolution images are large and can take a while to load.

Apple Podcasts suggests you compress your podcast artwork to optimize your file for mobile devices.

If your podcast is hosted on [Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/), we'll optimize your artwork automatically.

### 12\. Repurpose your artwork

Design your artwork so that it can be repurposed on other mediums.

You can use versions of your podcast cover art on social media, on business cards, and on your podcast website.

This creates a consistent podcast brand that listeners will recognize at a glance.
