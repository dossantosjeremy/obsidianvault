[Top tips to supercharge your podcast discovery on social media](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/grow/how-to-promote-podcast-social-media)

* Diversify content across platforms. From episode snippets and behind-the-scenes sneak peeks to guest features,
* - Not every platform is made equal. Each channel has its unique features, tone, and culture that can be leveraged to promote your podcast. Instagram's visual appeal, Twitter's real-time conversation, TikTok's viral content potential, and LinkedIn's community-building tools all offer different avenues to highlight your podcast and connect with your audience.
* - For closer, one-on-one audience engagement, actively respond to comments and direct messages (DMs) from fans on every platform. You can also host live sessions to interact with them in real time and chat about recent episodes.
* 
* 
* Content should attract attention
* Encourage shares and discussions
* New episode announcement*

* Episode assets
	* Audiograms: picture of whoever is speaking
	* Include episode cover as the visual asset
* Tease audience with cliffhangers and key quotes
* Promote past episodes with important insights
* Make it playful
	* - Make it playful by posing a question that's answered in your episode with a short timer
	* and then play the quote from your episode once the timer is up. Posts that have longer viewer retention tend to have better reach. ‍*
* Share the most intriguing or hilarious bit of the episode through snippets
* During editing, mark the timestamps
* Each clip should stand on its own. 
* Vary the lengths of videos. 
* Show your fans **what the making of an episode looks like**. Share insights into how you choose topics, research content, and plan your episodes. This could include brainstorming sessions, scriptwriting, or your reaction to finally booking a dream guest.
* **'A day in the life'** content showing the routine tasks of podcasting, like editing audio, selecting music, or managing social media, is another way to keep content fresh and authentic.
* Encourage guests to share the episode on their social media channels so you can tap into _their_ audience — it’s symbiosis at its finest. Provide them with all the necessary links and promotional materials to make the sharing process a breeze.
* Create eye-catching graphics or short video clips that feature your guest (like memorable quotes) and share them both before and after the episode airs to maintain interest.
* Stay informed on the topics and trends taking social media by storm. Spending some time on these channels every day is a good place to start. You can also look at [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com/) and set up [Google Alerts](https://www.google.com/alerts) for topics that are relevant to your podcast. Channel-specific tools, like the [YouTube trending tab](https://www.youtube.com/feed/trending), and [TikTok’s Trend Discovery](https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/inspiration/popular/pc/en) center, are also great resources.
* - To maximize the impact of this type of content, take a beat to find and use relevant hashtags associated with the trend. This increases the visibility of your posts to those who are actively following it.

* *
* - **Create templates** for social content, so you’re not always working from scratch. ‍For example, you could create a standardized [cover art](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/dos-donts-coverart) graphic, and then all you have to do is swap out the text for new episode titles.
* - **Craft content ahead of time** to avoid falling behind schedule. If you can, block off periods of time dedicated solely to working on batches of social media posts so you don’t have to think about creating assets—only posting.
* - ‍To make sure you don’t forget about a single post, **set calendar reminders** on the days you’re meant to share them. You can also schedule posts in advance with a social media tool or ‍use an Excel calendar sheet to plan when, where, and what you’ll post.*

* First, tackle the basics: Succinctly describe your podcast in your bio and include a call-to-action (CTA), such as “Listen to the latest episode” with a link to your podcast. With [Linktree](https://linktr.ee/), you can direct followers to your Spotify profile, other social media platforms, and website.

* You can leverage story highlights to categorize and archive important content like episode snippets, season [trailers](https://podcasters.spotify.com/resources/learn/create/why-your-podcast-needs-a-trailer), guest features, and fan reviews.*

* - **Feed posts.** Share high-quality images, quotes from episodes, and guest features. Remember the snippets we mentioned earlier? Put them to good use and populate your feed with a variety of them, whether it’s video or audio-only. With carousel posts, you can share multiple related images or quotes in a single post.
* 
* - **Reels.** This feature is all about engaging video content. Sneak peeks, recaps, episode or season trailers, and teasers for upcoming content are just some of the types of content you can share here. Reels can go up to 15 minutes, so they give you a lot of wiggle room.
* 
* - **Stories.** Unless you pin them to your highlights, Stories disappear within a day. They also have a limited runtime of 60 seconds, so they’re perfect for more casual, behind-the-scenes content, quick updates, or building up momentum for upcoming launches with teaser content.
* 
* ### X (Twitter): X (or the blue bird formerly known as Twitter) is useful for podcast promotion because you can showcase your point of view with written text as well as images and videos. Here’s the rundown:

‍

- **Pin a tweet** to the top of your profile that best represents your podcast. This could be a clip from your latest episode or an enticing description of your show with a link to your Spotify show page.

‍

- To keep your feed alive, **tweet regularly.** Due to its fast-paced nature and limited character count, you can keep it short and sweet with updates, episode releases, and relevant content that aligns with your podcast's theme.

‍

- You can **incorporate images, videos, and audiograms** to make your tweets more engaging. With threads, you can tell stories, share insights, or provide episode summaries in more detail.

‍

- **Actively retweet and respond to mentions**, comments, and messages. You can also live tweet during podcast recordings, events, or while listening to your new episodes to create real-time engagement and excitement around your content.*

### Facebook

* Unless your personal network is super relevant to your show, the best way to take advantage of Facebook is by **creating a dedicated page for your podcast**. This will be your own community, where you’re free to share anything related to your podcast with people who want to hear from you. Here are our top tips:

‍
- The content you create for other platforms, mainly TikTok and Instagram, will work just as well for Facebook. The platform supports images and videos up to 240 seconds long, so you don’t have to spend extra time producing content specifically for Facebook. Just remember to establish a consistent posting cadence with a good mix of formats.

‍

- You can easily share your show or an individual episode, directly from the Spotify app. Just tap the sharing menu, select the platform you want, and you’ll get a link to direct followers to your content.

‍

- For special occasions that you want to create a lot of hype around (like new season premieres, a live tour, or an interview with a special guest), you can create a dedicated Facebook Event to help build momentum and rally your audience.
## 
* Keep an eye on your performance with analytics

There’s only one way to know whether your social media strategy is bearing fruits—tracking the performance of your content.

‍

Analytics offer invaluable insights into what resonates with your audience, which platforms are most effective for your content, and how you can optimize your social media presence for maximum engagement and growth.

‍

Use each channel’s analytics features to monitor engagement, reach, and conversion metrics regularly and tweak your approach, content types, and posting cadence until you find the sweet spot.

‍

Happy posting!
