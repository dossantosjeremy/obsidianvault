### Content is King

-   Create engaging content. Do something that interests you or something you're passionate about. This will keep your enthusiasm high and will prevent you from podfading.
-   Ideally create a show on a niche topic. Podcasts with general topics like pop-culture or comedy have a lot of competition so you're better off niching down. The deeper knowledge you have on that topic or the greater access to guests you have in that space will help to determine your podcast success.
-   Make sure your content provides value, is informative or is entertaining.
-   Increase your publishing frequency. The more episodes you can produce the better. Each episode you produce creates new possibilities of reaching more audience, which leads to more impressions, which leads to more ad revenue. But don't water down your content just to increase your publishing frequency. Always make sure your content will be engaging.
-   Consistency pays off. Make sure to publish new episodes on the same day each week or same time each month. Your audience is depending on you and will expect new episodes to drop on those days This builds trust with your listening audience.
-   Give it time. Ideally publish 20+ episodes and try to commit to it for at least 6-months. Any less time and you probably won't see results.
-   Create the right format for your show and automate. Once you figure out the show format and outline that works best for you, stick to this and batch process. Batch Process! Many podcast pros will record 5-10 episodes during one day.
-   Find the right length for your show and stick to this. Don't publish one episode that's 15 minutes in length and another that's over an hour. Your listeners have set aside the right amount of time and don't want any surprises.
-   Review which podcast episodes have generated the most downloads and try to make more content like this or have similar type guests.
-   Create a catchy intro and outro. But don't make these too long, 10-seconds is plenty long.
-   If your show allots for it, create a mailbag segment. Listeners love hearing listeners' questions and of course love the possibility of their question being answered. This segment can increase engagement and gives you a chance to interact with your audience.
-   Having popular guests on the show is a great way to increase exposure. Be sure to have the guest promote the episode to their social media following. Even better, create a shareable link and send it to them so they can instantly share it.
-   If your podcast is an "interview" type show, do research on your guest and ask really good questions. Nobody wants to hear the same questions that were asked on the previous podcasts they were on. Dig into their background and ask relatable questions. Also don't be afraid to keep digging, like you ask one question and follow-up with what else? Sometimes the juicy stuff won't come out until the 3 pause or break from the same question. Doing research on your guest will please them as they will be excited to answer new questions they've never received before. This is what creates great content.
-   And of course your audio quality should be good. Check your sound levels and use a professional microphone that will give you optimal results. You can find pro grade microphones on the market these days for less than $100.

### Quick Wins That Really Work

-   Spruce up your album art. Think your album art is great? Ask a few of your friends for feedback. There are a ton of resources to help you find a graphic designer to help you design your album art. Check [Fiverr](https://www.fiverr.com/), [Design Pickle](https://designpickle.com/), [99 Designs](https://99designs.com/), Podcast Forums, and other resources.
-   Tell your audience to subscribe to your podcast on iTunes. The more people that subscribe to your show, the better you rank on iTunes. It's that simple. Now accumulating reviews on iTunes is helpful in regards to other listeners vetting out your show, but it doesn't help so much with Apple's ranking system. So make sure to focus first on getting subscribers and then reviews.
-   To get reviews faster, you could mention a goal for your listeners. Like once we reach 1,000 subscribers, we'll host a live public event in X City. So be sure to subscribe.
-   One way to get more reviews is to ask your audience to rate and review your show on iTunes. Select a winner each month from an iTunes review and giveaway a set of headphones, iTunes Gift Card, AirPods, etc. Read a few of your iTunes reviews on air. People will be encouraged to leave their own review to hear it read live on your show.
-   Ask your audience to share your show with others. Referrals are still one of the most popular ways people discover new podcasts.
-   One more thing you can mention at the end of your episodes is if anyone would like to advertiser or sponsor my/our show, please check out this website link (your listing on Libsyn Ads) or email [ad-sales@libsyn.com](mailto:ad-sales@libsyn.com) for more information.

### Marketing Tactics

-   Mention keywords or guest names first in episode titles. These perform better in Apple's Podcast keyword search results. For instance Tim Cook with Apple - Episode 50 is a lot better than Episode 50 - Tim Cook with Apple.
-   Try tweaking your keywords in your podcast title. Make sure to use specific keywords or phrases you want to capture in iTunes. But note these keywords or phrases shouldn't be too broad or too specific. Ideally somewhere right in the middle. You could use a [keyword planner tool like Google's](https://adwords.google.com/home/tools/keyword-planner/) that will tell you how many monthly impressions a specific keyword or phrase has.
-   Include one or two specific keywords in your podcast title that you want new listeners in iTunes to capture from search results. The key here is 1-2 keywords, don't over do it. You should instantly see a lift from this within one week.
-   Another trick here is to see what other related keywords iTunes suggests you search for at the bottom of the search query and use these in your episode titles too. Or a pro trick would be to actually create content in new episodes that captures these new suggested keywords.
-   Make sure to include ALL of your episodes in iTunes. Helps you get discovered and generates more downloads across your full back catalog.
-   Make sure you add your podcast to [Google Play](https://play.google.com/music/podcasts/portal/u/0/start#). It takes just a few minutes to sign up and it's becoming more important as Google is now indexing episodes right in search results. So when you have your podcast added to Google Play, your episodes will show right up in search results [like this](https://www.google.com/search?q=marketing+school+podcast&oq=marketing&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i65l2j69i61j69i60.1023j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8).
-   Write great episode titles and headlines that will attract new listeners. For instance: Top Hacks by Podcast Pros to Grow Your Listening Audience will outperform Great Ways to Grow Your Listener Base.
-   Mention your podcast name and website link in the signature area of your emails and posts.
-   Publish your episodes to all major podcast platforms including iTunes, Spotify, Google Play, and Stitcher.
-   Repurpose your audio on your YouTube Channel. The goal is to get your content everywhere.
-   Have TikTok influencers promote your podcast. Host a prize contest for which TikTok influencer can bring over the most listeners each month?
-   Get some [business cards](https://www.vistaprint.com/business-cards?couponAutoload=1&GP=07%2f02%2f2018+09%3a53%3a14&GPS=5100442840&GNF=0) printed with your podcast information on them. Leave these in public bathrooms, doctor's waiting rooms, mall cafeteria tables, windshields of cars in parking lots, public bathrooms, etc. Get the word out!
-   Implement an [Apple Smart Banner](https://blog.pacific-content.com/optimize-your-podcast-website-for-ios-with-a-single-line-of-code-cf56a7a3f486?gi=485c7e49a0a) on your podcast website. It's surprisingly simple just add the following tag in your site's <head>: <meta name="apple-itunes-app" content="app-id=XXXXXXXXXX"> Where XXXXXXXXXX is your show's unique numerical ID.
-   Use a tool called [SmarterQueue](https://smarterqueue.com/) to help schedule posts so you can spend less time trying to come up with content on the spot. This tool also saves you time when it comes to promoting via social media.
-   Claim your podcast on [Podcoin](https://www.podcoin.com/podcast-labs/2019/3/4/top-3-hacks-to-market-your-podcast-for-free). You will be featured in the "Bonus" section of their app, getting you in front of new listeners!
-   Make sure your podcast shows up in Google search results. Optimize your podcast and podcast episodes for SEO and Google search page rank. [Learn More](https://www.jeffbullas.com/podcast-seo/).
