June 10, 2022

There are many innovative ways to market your podcast, but certain tactics work better than others for independent podcasters.

We surveyed hundreds of Buzzsprout podcasters to figure out exactly what they did to achieve success. In this blog, we share 100 of the best marketing tactics from our survey, so you can use them to grow your own podcast.

**JUMP TO CATEGORY:**

## **Lay a strong foundation**

Laying a strong foundation for your podcast is pivotal to successful marketing. Here are some tips to help you create high-quality episodes that resonate with your listeners.

#### 1\. Love your topic

“Ultimately I believe your ambition and passion for any project is what truly sets you apart from other shows that just upload episodes every week.

People recognize when you truly care about something and that is what raises growth. If you care, they care.”  

–Kirk | [Kicking it With Kirk](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/kicking-it-with-kirk/id1188172427)

![Tip on growing a podcast](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/a90df42872ad3daee00d42b2b58a4489f5799dda_quote-1.png?auto=compress,format)

#### 2\. Do your research

“You have to make great content from day one. One way to do this is to follow your own taste in podcasts, and then investigate how those podcasts are made.

Reach out to them. Email the hosts and the producers. Ask about gear, interviewing, and all the nuts and bolts.

Figure out how you can get as close to their level of production as you can on your own level of resources, and then try and do that every single episode.”  

–David | [You Are Not So Smart](https://youarenotsosmart.com/podcast/)

#### 3\. Go deep

“There are a million podcasters out there (and more each day). To stand out you must either have a deeper knowledge base than your competition in your niche or a far deeper (and genuine) curiosity—but preferably both.”  

–Dov | [Leadership and Loyalty](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/dov-baron/leadership-and-loyalty)

#### 4\. Focus on quality

“Create consistent high-quality content and focus on making it good instead of worrying about growing it first.

Unless you have a professional sound engineer helping you, your quality is going to need work and the only way to improve it is through practice and a lot of trial and error.”  

–Tun | [Art Grind Podcast](https://artgrindpodcast.com/)

#### 5\. Be timely

"The more timely and relevant an episode or guest is, the more likely someone is to listen and share it."  

\- James, [Archipalago](https://www.buzzsprout.com/290047) 

#### 6\. Spend the time to book the best guests

“Focus primarily on getting the best guests relevant to the subject matter of the podcast. \[We interview\] the world's leading human longevity researchers and I have pulled out the stops to get key figures, with name recognition.

...I also try to conduct all my interviews in-person, even if this involves time-consuming travel. The resulting conversations are more personal and engaging than I believe can be achieved through remote links...”  

\-Peter | [Live Long and Master Aging](http://www.llamapodcast.com/)

#### 7\. Be a unique voice, but don't hold back valuable content

"Nothing you're doing is truly unique and the only thing holding back valuable information does is turn people away. Your competitors will copy you whether or not you share the secret sauce.

Sharing how it actually works will show you're a thought leader and that you want to better your industry. People who learn from you will point to you.

People who can't replicate what you taught will hire you to do it for them."  

–Bryan | [Sounds Profitable](https://soundsprofitable.com/)

#### 8\. Theme each episode

“Theme each episode so listeners know what will be covered and are more likely to share with others.”  

–Scott | [The Soccer Coaching Podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/247200)

#### 9\. Hook listeners at the beginning

"Look for hooks or pegs to hang each episode on — preferably in advance, but if a suitable hook becomes apparent later, that's fine too.

A good question to ask is, why should anyone listen to this episode now? Of course, it doesn't have to be for each episode, but the more the better."  

–James | [Archipalago](https://www.buzzsprout.com/290047)

#### 10\. Invest in audio

“Have the best audio possible within your budget. Content is great but if the listener struggles to understand then they will move on.”  

–Rob | [Major League Eventing Podcast](https://www.majorleagueeventing.com/podcast)

#### 11\. Be an editing perfectionist

“Editing is so important to becoming a successful podcast because if you can hear mistakes so can everyone else. Be a perfectionist and make sure everything sounds right before releasing it to the world.”  

–Brian | [Let’s Talk About Chef](https://www.buzzsprout.com/271862)

#### 12\. Have the right intention

"Make good content and have the right intention."

–Effie | [Once Upon A Gene](https://effieparks.com/)

![Quote about having the best audio possible within your budget](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/b983b7d39c25a35085059ac90d88befdf15e581a_quote-2.png?auto=compress,format)

#### 13\. Produce 5-10 episodes before launching your podcast

“Have about 5-10 episodes ready before launching the podcast. This will put less pressure on you and you will have worked out issues by the 8th or 10th episode.”   

–Tun | [Art Grind Podcast](https://artgrindpodcast.com/)

**PRO TIP**Share your first episode with people you know are in your target audience to get constructive feedback on areas you can improve.

#### 14\. Publish at a regular cadence

"Again...consistency. Don't burn out but find a schedule that is regular but works for you."

–Rob | [Straight To Video](https://straighttovideo.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 15\. Have a plan for each episode

“There’s nothing worse than listening to a podcast host that isn’t sure where they want the conversation to go.

Take the time to plan your episodes, maintain a consistent pace, and be diligent with what you keep and what should go on the chopping block.”  

–Travis | [How to Start a Podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1)

#### 16\. Nail your podcasting art & graphic design for promo materials

"\[Pay attention to your\] graphic design for promo materials and cover art...Show up every week, be consistent with your schedule, and produce a podcast that you’re proud of!"  

–Michele | [Therapy Roulette](https://therapyroulette.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 17\. Have a “how/where to listen” page on your podcast website

"Simple 'How to Listen' page on my site. This explains how to listen to the show, regardless of your technical knowledge, from podcast apps to using a web player. This is tied in with my newsletter, so it covers both options."  

–Danny | [Podcaster Stories](https://www.dannybrown.me/podcaster-stories/)

#### 18\. Utilize growth tactics you can measure

“Try data-driven tactics like Spotify ads, podcast addict, and Overcast ads.”  

–Fatima | [Quill Podcasting](https://www.quillpodcasting.com/)

#### 19\. Create a show you would want to listen to

“Focus on a niche, one you're interested in and part of and create a show that you would want to listen to, get inspiration and advice from.

By embracing your niche, you are zoning in on the audience and putting them first. You're also building a meaningful community for your audience.”  

–Kerry-Ann |[Carry On Friends The Caribbean American Podcast](https://carryonfriends.buzzsprout.com/685469)

#### 20\. Think beyond your immediate topic area

"Think beyond your show's immediate topic area to include adjacent topics and audiences that might resonate with the content.

For example, my show is on the topic of dating, but I expanded my search to include all communities that are interested in human connection stories, beyond the realm of romantic relationships."  

–Heather | [It’s Nice to Hear You](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/its-nice-to-hear-you/id1550711873)

#### 21\. Research topic’s keywords

"Researching keywords that people are searching for in related to my niche on platforms like Keysearch and Semrush."  

–Lerato | [Unpack Property Investment Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/unpack-property-investment-podcast/id1528844943)

#### 22\. Include episode transcriptions

"Transcriptions, making my show as accessible as possible for listeners with impaired hearing. This has really helped grow a section of the audience I'd be missing out on."  

–Danny | [Podcaster Stories](https://www.dannybrown.me/podcaster-stories/)

#### 23\. Start off strong with your launch

"Create a really big buzz through social media and in-person with networks of friends."  

–Stacie | [Man Shopping with Stacie](https://manshoppingwithstacie.com/podcast)

#### 24\. Be authentic

"We’ve been able to grow without guests! People like our authentic discussions."  

–Chris | [Parenting Autism](https://www.buzzsprout.com/227704)

#### 25\. Consider a non-scripted formation to increase engagement

"Having a nonscripted Podcast...helps the audience to connect easily."  

–Team Dokyalataapnako | [Dokyala Taap Nako](https://dokyalataapnako.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 26\. Learn how to consistently generate quality episode ideas

"It's easy to run dry with podcast ideas, but there are a lot of [tips](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/blog/how-to-come-up-topic-ideas-podcast-episodes/) you can use to come up with ideas your listeners will love."  

–[Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 27\. Be the expert in your field

"Our podcast is hyper-focused on a small subset of two industries, jewelry, and e-commerce. We try to lean into that to be the leading expert on BOTH so that we can pull an audience from both sides and influence and educate about emerging tech."  

–Michael | [In the Loupe](https://theloupepodcast.buzzsprout.com/1405180)

## **Know your audience**

It's important to know your audience so you can provide them with valuable content. These strategies can help you get started.

#### 28\. Identify a niche

“I had a broad, general topic when I first started podcasting: stories of female entrepreneurs. When I switched to specifically teaching entrepreneurs how to start, launch, and market their podcasts, I saw a shift in numbers almost immediately.

...The moral of the story is to niche down as much as possible so listeners know exactly what kind of value you offer them and why they should keep coming back every week.”  

–Krystal | [The Proffitt Podcast](http://krystalproffitt.com/podcast/)

#### 29\. Get inside your audience's head

“Know your audience like they're a friend. Know their struggles, wishes, fears, and basically be in their mind.

This will make your content essential and binge-worthy to your audience, who will then share it with like-minded people.”  

–Kim | [Teachers Need Teachers](https://teachersneedteachers.com/)

#### 30\. Use data

“Build a Google Analytics-backed landing page for your library of episodes. This helps you understand where your listeners are coming from, which can help you optimize based on channel.”  

–Jake | [Convoy Radio](https://convoy.com/blog/introducing-convoy-radio/)

#### 31\. Talk to your listeners

“It may seem obvious, but the fastest way to learn what your customers like and want to hear is by talking to them.

Use a Facebook group, set up a Google Form, or email them directly to solicit feedback and learn what you can do to serve your audience at a higher level.

Your [podcast host](https://resonaterecordings.com/2019/06/2019-top-5-podcast-hosting-platforms/) should have the ability to include a link to your form within your show notes.”  

–Travis | [Buzzcast](https://buzzcast.buzzsprout.com/)

![Quote about creating niche content with value for listeners](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/b23b693016e200f1cde2e1a9d90acf5b5378bfe8_quote-3.png?auto=compress,format)

#### 32\. Launch a podcast hotline where listeners can leave voicemails

"I launched a podcast hotline where my listeners can call in and leave a voicemail that will be featured in a future episode.

This is another amazing way for my listeners to feel like they are a part of my community and my podcast. These types of participation features bring in new listeners who are curious about all my offerings."  

–Melissa | [Mimosa Sisterhood](https://www.mimosasisterhood.com/mimosa-sisterhood-podcast-episodes/)

#### 33\. Start a Facebook group for your podcast to foster community

"Start a Facebook group on your subject matter right now and start building a following before you ever start the podcast.

Be helpful in other groups and answer questions other members have on your topic. This will build your reputation as a knowledgeable and trustworthy person on your topic."  

–Cynthia | [True Hauntings & Scary Stories](https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/1750123.rss)

#### 34\. Respect your audience’s time

"First, know and respect your audience. Everyone's time is precious and valuable. Respect your audience's time by giving them valuable information that helps them..."  

–Julie | [Paw Claws & Wet Noses](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1036900)

#### 35\. Engage with your DMs

"Even with a small social media following, your followers will likely respond to your content with questions and ideas, and it always makes listeners happy to get a timely response from the host him/herself."  

–[Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 36\. Get clarity on ideal listeners

"Get total clarity on their ideal listener and then go on other podcasts with that same type of listener and engage on social media where those types of listeners may be.

If you don’t know exactly who you’re trying to reach with your podcast, you’ll never know where to go to find those listeners, and no growth strategy will be effective."  

–Rob | [Contenders Wanted](https://contenderswanted.buzzsprout.com/)

## **Digital and content marketing**

Consider these digital marketing and content marketing strategies to help you get the word out about your podcast.

#### 37\. Use paid ads

“The single best tactic I've used to grow my podcast has been Facebook Ads. It may sound counterintuitive to pay for advertising, but it really can make a difference.

The amazing thing about Facebook Ads is that you can get very targeted listeners for your show if you set up your campaigns correctly. And this can lead to loyal listeners who will leave reviews and tell their friends about the show.”  

–Nicholas | [Growth Marketing Toolbox](https://earnworthy.com/podcast/)

**PRO TIP**Grow your podcast by repurposing your highlight clip as a podcast promo on [Buzzsprout Ads](https://www.buzzsprout.com/ads).

#### 38\. Tell everyone

"Just mention your podcast either actively or passively. Getting a haircut? 'Hey! Do you listen to podcasts?' At a party? 'So what have you been listening to, Brandon?' On a first date? 'Yeah, I produce my own podcast.'"  

–Brandon | [Jesus Hotline](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/jesus-hotline/id1450992262)

#### 39\. Leverage word of mouth marketing

“We have mostly used word of mouth to spread our podcast.

....We alternate guests that will help us grow our podcast audience base with other guests who provide quality content but don't have much social media presence.

By doing this, our listeners get to hear new ideas and see different perspectives which are important to us.”  

–Tun | [Art Grind Podcast](https://artgrindpodcast.com/)

#### 40\. Use search engine optimization

“I do keyword research around various topics to understand what people are searching for and are trying to find out more about. I take that into account when determining subject matter for new episodes.”  

–Travis | [The Winding Road Podcast](http://windingroadpodcast.com/)

**PRO TIP**Use targeted keywords in your episode titles to maximize your SEO and reach more potential listeners.

#### 41\. Cross-promote with guests

“When we have guests on, the guest generally promotes their appearance to their social circle as well.

Episodes where we've had guests generally have double the plays, and we see increased plays continue slowly over time after guest appearances.”  

–Chris | [Detroit Arcade Club](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/dac-cast/id1129052495)

#### 42\. Implement email marketing

“Every time I publish a new podcast, I send an email to everyone in my email database to announce the podcast.

I include information about the podcast in my quarterly newsletter as well as my weekly email to my database.”  

–Allison | [Middle Aging](https://middleagingpodcast.com/)

#### 43\. Add calls to action (CTAs)

“Include one specific call to action on each podcast episode to create interaction with your listeners.”  

–Juliette | [The Unwritable Rant](http://theunwritablerant.libsyn.com/)

![Quote about how guests can increase download numbers](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/067f2979c2e38af372e60fa2bcfc9595dff876ec_quote-4.png?auto=compress,format)

#### 44\. Hand out business cards

“I have designed and ordered some business cards with a QR code on them to hand out to businesses and people locally. The QR code takes them to our podcast website.”  

–Aaron | [Pilgrim’s Digress](https://www.buzzsprout.com/270941)

#### 45\. Send press releases

“Every time I publish a new podcast, I send out press releases to local media outlets explaining what the episode is about to see if I can get some media coverage.”  

–Allison | [Middle Aging](https://middleagingpodcast.com/)

#### 46\. Collaborate with other brands

“Connect with other podcasters to create those guest opportunities.”  

–Brad | [Queer Writers of Crime](https://www.queerwritersofcrime.com/)

#### 47\. Create a media kit

We sent the media kit with links to our episodes and asked people to share the podcast.”   

–Justin | [Category Is…](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/category-is/id1437814766)

#### 48\. Create a website for your podcast

“We set up a website and are asking listeners to subscribe so we can send them notifications when we release a new episode.”  

–Rene | [The Rough and Real Podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/232662)

#### 49\. Leverage blogging to maximize your reach

“We publish a linked article to our podcast in a blog post each week. We try to leverage our established WordPress blog to drive traffic to the podcasts.

We always link to relevant articles on the blog from the podcast so that interested listeners can see the medieval churches that we discuss.”  

–Dennis | [Light & Stone](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-val-daran/id1454079091?i=1000441282615)

#### 50\. Do live recordings

“I do live podcasts so that I can repurpose them. I record live, and then edit and upload for rebroadcast. It has been very successful and our live podcasts have been the most listened to episodes.”  

–Tanya | [Mom Your Business](https://momyourbusiness.org/)

#### 51\. Sell merchandise

“Creating a really catchy merch item like a hat, tote bag, or shirt with the name of our podcast begs passersby to ask about our podcast and start the conversation.”  

–Cate | [Gift of Gab with Cate and Kenya](https://www.buzzsprout.com/324704)

**PRO TIP**Do a podcast merch giveaway to reward listeners that promote or tweet your podcast to their followers.

#### 52\. Create a welcome email campaign

–Danny | [Podcaster Stories](https://podcaster%20stories/)

#### 53\. Create a podcast trailer at launch

"Releasing a short podcast trailer on or prior to launch (in addition to some full episodes) helps establish what your content is about, and acts as a teaser to get listeners excited for more future episodes."  

–[Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 54\. Leverage star power

"Star power. Our show's popularity increased incrementally once we started bringing in ‘celeb’ crossovers of relevance to our community. It really is as simple as their fans become your fans."  

–Paulo | [That 80s Show SA](https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy84YWYxODgwL3BvZGNhc3QvcnNz)

#### 55\. Create & sell an ebook related to content

"I self-published a fictional horror book in October 2020 and used the same tactic to promote it along with some paid Facebook and Pinterest ads, too."  

–Cynthia | [True Hauntings & Scary Stories](https://feeds.buzzsprout.com/1750123.rss)

#### 56\. Make a “promo squad”

"I started with a "promo squad" before launch (friends and family that were on board to help me get the word out).

I set up social media accounts to remind people I'm still alive and doing the thing, I have published consistently each week for 91 weeks & I create multiple social media assets for my guests to share before their episode comes out."

–Meredith | [Meredith for Real: The Curious Introvert](https://www.buzzsprout.com/672526)

#### 57\. Send new episode alerts to contacts

"Discoverability is one of the biggest issues for new podcasters. So think about your distribution plan (how you're going to get your podcast in front of new eyeballs) as much as possible."  

–Blythe | [Digital Dispatch Podcast](https://digitaldispatch.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 58\. Learn podcasting SEO basics

–[Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/)

–Al | [Clear Visions Podcast](https://www.mralpete.com/clearvisionspodcast)

#### 60\. Create a lead magnet to grow your email list

"Have a freebie/lead magnet to grow your list...Build an email list and send out regular newsletters and new episodes. Post about every new episode on your personal social handles..."  

–Hannah | [Birth Your Vision Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/birth-your-vision-podcast/id1493405653)

#### 61\. Get support from experts

"If you have the budget, you can hire podcast promotion services (like [Lower Street](https://lowerstreet.co/podcast-promotion-service)) to do some of the heavy lifting for you."  

–[Buzzsprout](https://www.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 62\. Promote to social media channels consistently

"We have four social media accounts that we post to consistently.

We post the new episode covers, episode audiogram clips, original memes, episode quotes, and we recently started polling on Twitter to ask listeners for their thoughts on topics discussed in the episode."  

–Josie | [OL’ SOUL FLO’](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ol-soul-flo/id1515745407)

#### 63\. Get featured in a newspaper

"I got featured in a free newspaper that is BANG ON for my target market. Listenership grew by a third."

–Jessica | [Comeback Coach](https://comebackcoach.buzzsprout.com/1575013)

–[Convoy Radio](https://convoy.com/radio/)

#### 66\. Publish on multiple platforms

“One method I use to grow my podcast is to make it available on multiple podcast platforms such as Apple Podcasts (formerly iTunes), Stitcher, and Google Play Music.

Listeners can download episodes directly from my website as well. Podcasting is still a medium in its nascent stage with many distribution outlets, so it behooves podcasters to make consuming their shows as easy for their audiences as possible.”  

–Rod | [EYE ON SCI-FI](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the7thmatrixcom-eye-on-scifi-podcast/eye-on-scifi-podcast)

![Quote about finding social communities where you can talk about your podcast](https://images.prismic.io/buzzsprout/3fcb560913ec431e1c0dd4394143a1285fb83d5b_quote-5.png?auto=compress,format)

#### 74\. Use hashtags

“I make sure that I promote every episode on social media via carefully placed hashtags and photo content. Every post and every hashtag is as important as the week before.”  

–Brian | [Let’s Talk About Chef](https://www.buzzsprout.com/271862)

#### 75\. Find influencers

“You must find influencers within the industry to validate your podcast content and get their take on the industry. Their popularity and knowledge help you grow.”

#### 76\. Comment on other podcasts’ pages

Be creative and seamless. I and others have enjoyed reading these comments and have discovered new things based on what others have recommended.”  

–Remi | [Two Birds Flock](https://www.buzzsprout.com/283500)

#### 77\. Don’t forget about video

“I've used soundbites that Buzzsprout has created for my episodes and uploaded them to YouTube to share as videos across all my social media platforms.

I've also started to stream on Twitch where I promote my podcast on my page and within my stream. I've noticed that streaming on Twitch and being active within the community that is specific to my genre has been really beneficial.”  

–Jordyn | [Murder is My Sign](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/jordy-death/murder-is-my-sign)

"\[Use\] quotes from the episode into 3-5 social-friendly graphic/image galleries. You can make these on the fly with a graphic design tool like Canva."  

–Blythe | [Digital Dispatch Podcast](https://digitaldispatch.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 79\. Create valuable TikTok videos

"Social media but specifically Tiktok! Started putting out three videos a day back in December & have grown to 134.5k followers.

...I just tell short stories related to the theme of the podcast (paranormal/myths/legends), nothing fancy...I've also seen podcasts put clips of themselves recording and that does well, too."  

–Cristina | [Espooky Tales](https://espookytales.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 80\. Consider getting on Twitter

"Brave it and get on Twitter. Start looking for an audience who will appreciate your output."  

–James | [Fsobriety](https://fsobriety.buzzsprout.com/1263485)

#### 81\. Follow people on Twitter who listen to shows like yours

–Kenny | [\[Abridged\] Presidential Histories](https://aph.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 82\. Don’t be afraid to share your episodes on social channels more than once

"Don't be afraid to share the episode more than once! Social media algorithms are a beast, and chances are only 5-10% of your audience (if that) saw the post the first time around.

Share an episode multiple times, and be sure to tag any guests/companies/tools mentioned during that episode to help with additional organic boost."  

–Blythe | [Digital Dispatch Podcast](https://digitaldispatch.buzzsprout.com/)

#### 83\. Run a competition

"This month, we are running a competition to win one of three signed copies of the book written by our guest expert. His book is very beautiful to look at and will make nice imagery for our social media channels, so this will help a lot."  

–Helen | [The Wildlife Community Podcast](https://www.podchaser.com/podcasts/the-wildlife-community-podcast-1857810)

## **Social networking**

Making connections with podcasters and experts on your topic is a great way to spread the word about your podcast. Here are some tips on how to grow your podcast through networking.

#### 84\. Leverage personal networks

“I have been using my groups of friends to grow the podcast. I have found they are much more likely to share it with their friends as they want to support me.

This has produced a knock-on effect that has grown my podcast more than I ever would have thought possible.”  

–Merry | [Flying in the Face of Fate](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/flying-in-the-face-of-fate)
