**Number of Cards:** [Insert number]

## 2. Quantitative Analysis

### 2.1 Frequency of Card Groupings

* If >75% of participants grouped [Card A] and [Card B] together > It means these items are strongly associated in users' minds and should be placed in the same category.

* If 50-75% of participants grouped [Card A] and [Card B] together > It suggests a moderate association between these items. Consider placing them in the same category or creating a clear link between their respective categories.

* If <50% of participants grouped [Card A] and [Card B] together, but it's still the most common grouping > It indicates a weak association. Further investigation may be needed to understand the relationship between these items.

* If [Card X] was placed into >5 different groupings by participants > It suggests this item may be ambiguous or could potentially fit into multiple categories. Consider clarifying its content or creating cross-links.

* If [Card Y] was consistently placed alone or not grouped by >25% of participants > It may indicate that this item is unique and might require its own category or special treatment in the information architecture.

### 2.2 Matrix Visualization

[Insert heat map or similarity matrix]

* If the matrix shows a strong correlation (>0.8) between [Category 1] and [Category 2] > It indicates users see a close relationship between these categories. Consider merging them or creating a clear hierarchy.

* If the matrix shows a moderate correlation (0.5-0.8) between [Category 1] and [Category 2] > It suggests some overlap in users' minds. Consider creating clear links between these categories or investigate if a subcategory could bridge them.

* If the matrix shows weak correlations (<0.5) across all categories > It may indicate that the current categorization is not intuitive to users. Consider re-evaluating the entire structure.

* If [Category X] shows weak correlations (<0.5) with all other categories > It suggests this category may be distinct and well-defined in users' minds.

## 3. Qualitative Analysis

### 3.1 Participant Comments

* If >50% of participants mentioned [specific comment or concern] > It strongly suggests that [insert potential implication for information architecture].

* If 25-50% of participants mentioned [specific comment or concern] > It indicates a notable trend that should be considered in the information architecture design.

* If <25% but >2 participants mentioned [specific comment or concern] > It may represent a minority view but should be noted for potential edge cases or future consideration.

### 3.2 Rationale Behind Decisions

* If >75% of participants cited [specific reason] for grouping [Cards X, Y, Z] together > It strongly indicates that [insert insight about user mental model or expectation].

* If 50-75% of participants cited [specific reason] for grouping [Cards X, Y, Z] together > It suggests a common mental model that should be considered in the information architecture.

* If participants provided widely varying rationales for grouping [Cards X, Y, Z] > It may indicate confusion or multiple valid ways of categorizing these items. Consider using cross-links or multiple categorization options.

## 4. Pattern and Cluster Identification

### 4.1 Cluster Analysis Results

[Insert dendrogram or cluster diagram]

* If [Cards A, B, C] form a tight cluster with a similarity >0.8 > It strongly suggests these items should be grouped together in the final information architecture.

* If [Cards D, E, F] form a moderate cluster with a similarity between 0.5-0.8 > Consider grouping these items together or creating a clear relationship between them in the information architecture.

* If [Card X] appears as an outlier with similarity <0.3 to all other cards > It may indicate that this item doesn't fit well into any category and might need to be reconsidered or given its own section.

* If the dendrogram shows clear, distinct clusters > It suggests that participants have a clear mental model of the categorization. Use these clusters as a basis for your information architecture.

* If the dendrogram shows many small, fragmented clusters > It may indicate that participants struggled to find clear categories. Consider simplifying the overall structure or providing more context for categorization.

### 4.2 Theme Identification

* If >3 of the most common categories created by participants relate to [specific theme] > It indicates that this theme is a key organizing principle for users and should be prominently featured in the information architecture.

* If participants created categories that don't align with the current website structure > Consider reorganizing the site structure to better match users' mental models.

* If participants consistently created a category for [specific content] that wasn't anticipated > Consider adding this category to the information architecture.

## 5. Open vs. Closed Sort Comparison (if applicable)

* If the open sort resulted in significantly more categories (>50% more) than the closed sort > It suggests that the predefined categories may be too broad and could benefit from subcategories.

* If the open sort resulted in significantly fewer categories (<50% of closed sort) > It indicates that the predefined categories may be too granular and could benefit from consolidation.

* If participants in the open sort consistently created a category for [specific content] that wasn't in the closed sort > Consider adding this category to the information architecture.

* If participants in the closed sort frequently misplaced items in [Category X] > It suggests that this category label may be unclear or the items within it may not be cohesive. Consider renaming or restructuring this category.

## 6. Outliers and Anomalies

* If [Card X] was placed in different categories by >30% of participants > It may indicate confusion about this item's content or purpose. Consider clarifying its description or splitting it into multiple cards.

* If [Card Y] was frequently left unsorted or placed in a "miscellaneous" category > It might suggest that this item doesn't clearly belong to any category. Consider if it's necessary or if it needs to be better defined.

* If a significant number of participants (>10%) created an unexpected category [Category Z] > It may reveal a user need or perspective not previously considered. Investigate the rationale behind this category.

## 7. Key Insights and Recommendations

### 7.1 User Expectations and Mental Models

* If users consistently grouped items differently from the current site structure > We recommend restructuring the information architecture to align with user expectations, specifically [insert specific recommendations].

* If users created similar categories across different demographic groups > It suggests a consistent mental model across your user base. We recommend using this structure as the foundation for your information architecture.

* If different user groups (e.g., novices vs. experts) created notably different structures > Consider creating different navigation paths or views for different user types.

### 7.2 Proposed Category Structure

[Insert proposed category structure based on analysis]

* We propose this structure because [insert rationale based on findings]. Specifically:
  - Category A is based on [insert insight]
  - Category B addresses the user need for [insert need]
  - Categories C and D were merged due to [insert reason]

### 7.3 Labeling Recommendations

* Consider changing [current label] to [proposed label] because [insert reason based on user feedback or grouping patterns].

* If users consistently used a different term for [Category X] > We recommend adopting this user-generated label to improve intuitive navigation.

* If users showed confusion over the meaning of [Term Y] > Consider providing a clear definition or using a more self-explanatory term.

## 8. Next Steps

* If the card sort revealed significant differences from the current structure > We recommend conducting a tree test to validate the proposed new structure.

* If certain categories or items showed high levels of inconsistency in sorting > We suggest conducting further user research (e.g., interviews, surveys) to better understand user perceptions of these elements.

* If the card sort revealed potential new features or content areas > Consider a content audit to identify gaps in current offerings.

## 9. Limitations of the Study

* If the participant sample was not fully representative of the target user base > Results may be skewed and additional testing with a broader sample may be necessary.

* If certain cards were frequently misunderstood or required explanation > It may have impacted the natural sorting process. Consider refining card labels for future studies.

* If the number of cards was very high (>50) > Participant fatigue may have affected the results, particularly for later cards in the sort.
