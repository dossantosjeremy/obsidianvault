# Card Sorting Analysis Document Template for dscout Outputs

## 1. Overview

**Date of Analysis:** [Insert date]
**Number of Participants:** [Insert number]
**Type of Card Sort:** [Open / Closed / Hybrid]
**Number of Cards:** [Insert number]

## 2. Agreement Matrix Analysis

[Insert screenshot or data from the agreement matrix]

* If >75% of participants sorted [Card A] into [Category X] > This indicates a strong agreement and suggests that [Card A] clearly belongs in [Category X] in the users' mental model.

* If 50-75% of participants sorted [Card B] into [Category Y] > This shows moderate agreement. Consider placing [Card B] in [Category Y], but investigate if there are other strong alternatives.

* If <50% of participants agreed on any single category for [Card C] > This suggests confusion about [Card C]'s categorization. Consider:
  - Clarifying the card's content or label
  - Creating cross-links between categories
  - Investigating qualitative feedback for insights

* If [Card D] shows roughly equal distribution between two or more categories > This might indicate that the card content is relevant to multiple categories. Consider:
  - Using the card in multiple categories
  - Creating a new category that combines these concepts
  - Refining the card's content to make it more specific

* If a row in the matrix shows low agreement across all categories > This card may be problematic and require revision or removal.

## 3. Card View Analysis

For each card with notable patterns:

### [Card Name]

* Sorted into [Category 1] by [X%] of participants
* Sorted into [Category 2] by [Y%] of participants
* Sorted into [Category 3] by [Z%] of participants

Analysis:
* If one category dominates (>60%) > This suggests a clear preference for categorization.
* If two categories are close in percentage > This might indicate a need for cross-linking or subcategories.
* If many categories have low percentages > This could suggest the card is ambiguous and needs clarification.

Recommendation:
[Insert recommendation based on the analysis, e.g., "Place in Category 1 with a cross-link to Category 2" or "Revise card label to clarify its content"]

## 4. Category View Analysis

For each significant category:

### [Category Name]

* Contains [X] cards with >75% agreement
* Contains [Y] cards with 50-75% agreement
* Contains [Z] cards with <50% agreement

Most frequently included cards:
1. [Card A] - [Percentage]%
2. [Card B] - [Percentage]%
3. [Card C] - [Percentage]%

Least frequently included cards:
1. [Card X] - [Percentage]%
2. [Card Y] - [Percentage]%
3. [Card Z] - [Percentage]%

Analysis:
* If the category has many high-agreement cards > This suggests it's a well-defined, intuitive category for users.
* If the category has mostly low-agreement cards > This might indicate the category is too broad or unclear to users.
* If there's a mix of high and low agreement cards > Consider refining the category definition or creating subcategories.

Recommendation:
[Insert recommendation based on the analysis, e.g., "Keep category as is," "Split into subcategories," or "Merge with another similar category"]

## 5. Key Insights and Recommendations

Based on the agreement matrix, card view, and category view analyses:

### 5.1 Strong Agreement Areas
* [List categories or groupings with consistently high agreement]
* Recommendation: Use these as the foundation for your information architecture.

### 5.2 Areas of Confusion
* [List cards or categories with low agreement or inconsistent sorting]
* Recommendation: [For each, provide a specific suggestion for improvement]

### 5.3 Emerging Patterns
* [Describe any unexpected groupings or categories that emerged]
* Recommendation: [Suggest how to incorporate these insights into the information architecture]

### 5.4 Proposed Information Architecture
[Insert a high-level overview of the proposed structure based on the analysis]

### 5.5 Labeling Recommendations
* [List any category or card labels that may need revision based on user sorting patterns]
* Suggested changes: [Provide specific label change recommendations]

## 6. Next Steps

* If the card sort revealed significant differences from the current structure > Conduct a tree test to validate the proposed new structure.
* If certain cards or categories showed low agreement > Consider follow-up user interviews to gain deeper insights into user thought processes.
* If new groupings emerged > Evaluate if these should be incorporated into the site's content strategy.

## 7. Limitations of the Study

* [Discuss any limitations specific to this study, such as participant demographics, number of cards, or type of sort]
* If the participant sample was not fully representative of the target user base > Note that results may be skewed and additional testing with a broader sample may be necessary.
