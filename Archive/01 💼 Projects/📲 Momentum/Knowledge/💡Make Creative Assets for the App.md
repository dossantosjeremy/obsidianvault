* What is our goal: Drive Downloads

### Align with the respective ad group’s theme, if applicable
Ad groups in App campaigns allow you to “group” your creative assets around specific app features or messages you want to highlight, or user demographics you want to engage. Your assets should thus represent those distinct features, messages, and user needs (for example, upload sushi-themed creatives in one ad group to attract sushi lovers, and pizza-themed creatives in another ad group for takeout fans).
