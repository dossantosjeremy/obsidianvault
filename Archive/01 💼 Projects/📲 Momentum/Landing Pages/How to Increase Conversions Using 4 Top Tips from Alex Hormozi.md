In his best-selling book [$100 Million Offers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/100M-Offers-People-Stupid-Saying-ebook/dp/B099QVG1H8), Alex Hormozi ( the undisputed king of sales ) outlines 4 things he uses to close more sales.

In this post I'm going to list these 4 things.

We're also going to cover how can use them on your landing page to get more conversions.

Let's get stuck in!

### To get more sales, your landing page needs to effectively communicate 4 things to your customer:

1.  Your customers dream outcome
    
2.  How long it will take to achieve dream outcome
    
3.  Assure customers your product can help them achieve dream outcome
    
4.  Let customers know how much effort is required for dream outcome.
    

#### 1\. Feature your customers dream outcome

Always list your customers dream outcome on your landing page.

For example, it could be save money, lose weight or learn a valuable new skill.

Featuring your users dream outcome can be done by listing the dream outcome in your landing page headline.

For example:

**"Save $100's on your car insurance"**

#### Example of a dream outcome featured on a landing page:

### 2\. List how long their dream outcome will take

Customers want to know how long it will take to achieve their dream outcome using your product.

Let them know on your landing page!

For example, if I have a product that creates AI generated profile shots - let me know how long it will take to get my photos.

This can be done using copy:

**"Get your professional AI generated profile photos in just 30 minutes"**

### 3\. Assure customers their dream outcome is possible

Customers want proof your product actually does what you say it does.

Testimonials from your existing customers are a great way to prove to your customers what your product actually works.

Use testimonials generously on your landing page for the win.

#### Using testimonials is a great way to assure potential customers they will get the result their after:

Customers want to know how much effort is required on their part to get their desired result.

Ideally you want your product to achieve the dream result in as few steps as possible.

There are a number of ways you can communicate how easy and little effort it takes for your product to get the desired dream outcome.

Popular ways to convey this on [landing pages](https://cursorup.com/blog/landing-pages/) include:

-   A how it works section
    
-   An FAQ section
    
-   A demo video
    

#### A 'How it works' is a great way to let customers know how the steps required to get their dream result:
