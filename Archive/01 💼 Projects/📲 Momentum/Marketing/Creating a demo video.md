[How to create a cool demo video for your SaaS: a step-by-step guide : r/SaaS](https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/17p6eoa/how_to_create_a_cool_demo_video_for_your_saas_a/

1. Record a product demonstration. For this, I used Arcade (which is free for video recording). It's a Chrome extension that allows you to record your Google Chrome browser, and you can later edit and export this recording as a video. If you prefer something simpler, you can just record your screen with Quicktime.
    
2. Import this video into Final Cut (you can get a free 90-day trial version here). If you're on Windows, Da Vinci appears to be a free alternative. You'll need to edit your video, including cutting out any overly long parts or rearranging sequences in your demo.
    
3. Add a voiceover. Nowadays, it's super easy â€“ you can use a high-quality AI-generated synthetic voice from ElevenLabs. It's free for up to 10,000 words (which should be sufficient for your demo). Of course, you'll need to write the script, so keep it concise and to the point. I recommend writing the script sequence by sequence since it should match the duration of each video segment. Avoid sequences without voice as they disrupt the flow.
    
4. Add sound effects. The goal is to make your video come to life. Epidemic Sound provides a library of sound effects, such as mouse clicks and keyboard sounds, for free during the first 30 days.
    
5. Include music. Every good demo video has a rhythm provided by music. The music should match the tone of your demo and your brand. It's subjective but important. Again, it's available for free at Epidemic Sound.
    
6. Incorporate your logo into the video. It's about promoting your brand, not just your software. Figma (which is free) will be a great help here.
    
7. (Optional) Animate your logo using Motion on MacOS. It's a paid software but quite affordable at $49. There are some YouTube tutorials for creating simple animations. The idea is not to spend days on it but to make your logo a bit dynamic.
    
8. Bring all these elements together in your editing software (Final Cut or Da Vinci). Sync the images with the sounds and music.
    
9. Keep in mind that the demo should flow smoothly. If certain parts feel too lengthy, they probably are! Don't hesitate to trim them down to get straight to the point. The longer the demo, the more likely you'll lose viewers along the way.
    

You'll invest about 3 hours of work without needing any specific expertise. If you require assistance, especially with Final Cut, there are YouTube tutorials that explain how to get started with this type of software. You can stick to basic functions like cutting and moving sequences â€“ that should be more than enough.

Your result won't be perfectly professional, of course. But your video will exist and explain why your product is cool! Dropbox's first demo video wasn't flawless, but it's widely acknowledged that it significantly contributed to their success. I wish all of you the same success ðŸš€

This guide can be improved, so if you have any suggestions for enhancing my demo video, I'm open to your feedback. Thanks in advance.
