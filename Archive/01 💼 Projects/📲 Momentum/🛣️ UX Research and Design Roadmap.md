# Empathise, define and ideate

## Recruit

### Process to recruit
1. Determine interview goals
2. Form a representative sample
3. Search for participants
	1. Personal network: Family, friends, colleagues who fit the demographics of the target user we are designing for. 
	2. Existing user base: Example use the user base from competitors. 
	3. Online: 
		1. Specific websites such as UserTesting or UserInterviews
		2. Networking sites such as linkedin
		3. Online communities (e.g. Reddit)
	4. Intercept recruiting
4. Screener survey
5. Select the participants (those who align with the interview goals)
6. Reach out to participants
	1. Greetings to introduce myself and the project
	2. Explain why we are reaching out to them
	3. Share the logistics of the interview
	4. Explain the setup for the interview. 
	5. Wrap the email explaining how they can book the interviews (Answering the email or via a link)
	6. Include the incentive

### Considerations
What to consider when recruiting participants
* Impairments or disabilities
	* Temporary
	* Situational 
	* Permanent
> Here we can recruit them based on their use of assistive technology. 
* User familiarity with technology
	* Digital litteracy
	* Confidence to explore a new technology
	* Willingness to explore a new technology
* How are users accessing the product or service
	* Consider cost
	* Consider availability of internet
* Where and when users are accessing the service or product
* Who are all the potential users
* Demographics
	* Age
	* Gender
	* Income level
	* Ethnicity
	* Educational background
	* Geographic Location
		* Cultural norms
		* Local languages (example which language is used on a given device)


### Write a research plan

#### Template of a research plan 

##### Research background

##### Research Statement

##### Research objectives

###### Guidelines
* 2-5 research goals
* 4-7 Interview questions*

###### Examples 
* I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
- I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I‚Äôm designing.
- Are there certain user problems or pain points we need to empathize with
2. What are the characteristics of users we want to interview and why?

**Examples of research objectives**

##### Research questions

##### Scope
Participants

##### Methodology

##### Script
Interview questions should be aligned with the final goals


## Run research

### Conduct user interviews

##### Dry run 
* Deliver the questions you will ask users before the real interview
* Make sure the interview runs smoothly
* Determine if the length of the interview is appropriate

### Real interviews
* Build rapport: Build a professional but friendly interaction
* Thank the user for coming
* Gather basic details: Names or demographic details
* Use a clear and concise language
* Ask open end-ended questions
* Ask follow-up questions
* Keep questions short and simple
* Highlight compelling quotes
* Document observations about participants: What users say, mood, expression, body language, behavior
	* Observe users inter with you or the product
* Make sure the feedback is objective and unbiased
* Put biases aside: Do not complicate feedback with own opinions and emotions. 
* Give users the chance to share final thoughts
* Thank participants once more 
* Ask users a lot of questions
	* Ask about needs and wants
	* Ask questions that start with what, how and why

## Empathise

### Empathy maps
* Add the users name
* 4 quadrants
	* Says
		* Exact quotes from the participant
		* Capture themes in the interview that relate to the product
		* Pay attention to the challenges the use rfaces
		* Pay attention to desired benefits or expectations
	* Thinks
		* Summarize thoughts conveyed by the user
		* Add feelings through body language, tone ,facial expression
	* Does: Actions the user is performing
	* Feels: Everything the user says he is feeling
		* Either based on how we feel the user is feeling
		* Or by probing the user on his or her feelings with the question ‚ÄúHow does this make you feel‚Äù
* 2 types of empathy maps
	* One user empathy map: Take data from one user interview and turn it into an empathy map
	* Aggregated empathy map
		* Group of users who share similar thoughts, opinions or qualities
		* Aggregating multiple one-user empathy maps
		* Combine the maps where users express similar things into a new empathy map
### Pain points
* Financial pain points: Problems related to money
* Product Pain Points: Quality issues related to the product
* Process Pain Points: Frustrations stopping users from going from point A to B, problems related to the user journey 
* Support Pain Points: When users cannot find the answers to their questions, or related to getting help from customer service

### Personas 

#### Theory
* Personas should represent a group of users with similar characteristics
* It is a fictional representation of a user segment, embodying characteristics, needs, behaviors, responses
* Look for common themes in the data and group these with users who personify those themes together
* Creating 3 to 8 personas: Enough to represent the majority of user base
* For each persona we should have 4-6 real interview subjects for each group of users. 
* Consider the demographic information that should match the persona: Location, age range, education level, employments, household or family composition, ability, gender, race and ethnicity, language
* Have a quote: 
	* Relevant to the persona and the background we build for him.*
	* Communicate the persona attitude and personality. 
	* Paragraph describing their life
* Goals: List of goals the persona wants to complete
* Frustrations: Frustrations for the issues they encounter or try to avoid. 
* Story or scenario. Should tie
	* Goals
	* Frustrations 
	* Quotes
* Image: Include a picture or avatar representing the persona
* Get opinion from the team on the personas
* Make sure we have key identifiable differences between personas

#### Practice
Google template accessible here: [[Archive/01 üíº Projects/üì≤ Momentum/02. Resources]]
* Obsidian Template: [[Persona Template]] 

### User Journeys

#### Early stage of the project
- Tracks the general experience the user goes through to complete their goal
- How the user goes about their day while trying to achieve a goal

#### Late in the design process
- How the user interacts with the product

#### Process
* Add the persona name
* Identify a business goal
* Add the actions the persona is taking in their journey to achieve the goal
* Add 2-3 tasks for each action
* Indicate how the user is feeling at each point*
* Include accessibility
* Check assumptions, biases and ideas
* Highlight pain points
* Identify improvements and opportunities
![[Pasted image 20240401165303.png]]
### User Stories

#### Theory 
* Fictional one-sentence story told from the persona POV to inspire and inform decisions. 
* Concise narrative describing users‚Äò objectives, actions and motivations. 
*  As a type of user = WHO, I want to action (WHAT) so that benefit (WHY).‚Äô*
* Keep them short, impactful and to the point, with a clear action and benefit
* Use them as a checklist to address key user problems in product design
#### Practice
1. Identify user types
2. Consider their pain points
3. Identify user actions (actions that help them have a better experience)
4. Benefits: Why each user would want to perform the action

## Define

### Problem Statement
#### Theory 
* Clear description of the users‚Äò needs that should be addressed
* Human centered
* Broad enough for creative freedom
* Narrow enough to be solved by a practical design solution

#### Practice
1. Name of the user
2. Short description of the user characteristics
3. Users‚Äò needs
4. Why the user has those needs
* [ User Name ] is a [ User Characteristics ] who needs [ User needs ] because [ Insight ]
* 5 WH 1 Framework
	* **Who** is experiencing the problem? 
	* **What** are the pain points you‚Äôre trying to solve? 
	* **Where** is the user when they‚Äôre using the product? 
	* **When** does the problem occur? 
	* **Why** is the problem important? 
	* **How** are users reaching their goals by using the product? 

### Hypotheses statements

#### Process
1. Action to take to solve the suers‚Äò needs
2. Outcome we can expect from this action
3. Reword the hypothesis statement if necessary

#### Formats
* If/Then formats: 
	* Focuses on the needs of the user
	* If [ User Action ]then [ Outcome on the UX ]
* We believe format
	* Take the product team needs into account and remains empathetic to the needs of the user
	* We believe that [ Action we take ] for [ User ] will [ Impact on the UX ]

### Competitive audit

#### Includes
* Direct competitors: Similar offerings and focusing on same audience
* Indirect competitors: Similar offering, different audience or different offerings with same audience. *

#### How to use a competitive audit
* Give ideas of products on the market and their designs
- Give ideas to solve problems with the current design
- Find ways with which products in the market are not solving users‚Äô needs
- Learning from competitors‚Äô mistakes
- Create something for the user that is completely different from the competition.¬†
- Combining strengths of competitors into one product.
- Informing the design process
- Revealing gaps in the market


- Direct competitors: Similar offerings and focusing on same audience
- Indirect competitors: Similar offering, different audience or different offerings with same audience. *

#### Step-by-step process

1. Outline audit goals. Example: Compare the UX of each competitor‚Äôs website.¬†
2. Define a consistent language for rating competitors
	- Needs work:¬†The app is not usable, and users aren‚Äôt getting what they need from this aspect of the app.
	- Okay:¬†This aspect has some issues, but with some work, it could meet user needs.
	- Good:¬†This aspect works well, but doesn‚Äôt always provide users with the necessary information easily.
	- Outstanding:¬†This aspect feels consistent, and it meets or exceeds the user‚Äôs needs.
3. List competitors (between 3  and 6)
	- Direct
	- Indirect competitors
4. Consider the aspects you want to compare from competitors (see below)
5. Research each company
6. Include bullet point information
7. Include photos or screenshots
8. Analyze findings and summarize in a report (see below)

  
#### Aspects to compare between competitors

| **First impressions:** | **Check out the website on both desktop and mobile devices, and make note of your first impressions.<br>Is the website responsive, meaning that it resizes across devices?<br>Does the design complement the product? How do you feel about the website?**                                                                                      |

## Ideate 

### Design ideation in general

* It is important to define the problem
* Knowing what problem you need to solve will keep the users' needs top of mind
* Think big and get creative while ideating. 
* There is no right or wrong way to practice design ideation. 
* The first solutions we generate are often the least creative because they are the most obvious

### Crazy Eights

#### How it works
- Each person draws 8 sketches of their own
- Coming together, thinking about a favorite idea
- Sharing top 2-3 ideas with the whole group
- The best idea is elaborated through more sketches
- Coming up with as many ideas as 

#### How to do it
1. Identify the problem scenario
	1. Identify gaps
	2. Identify opportunities
2. Start with. Asheet of paper, something to draw, timer
3. Let the ideas flow
	1. Draw any and every solution that comes to your mind
	2. If more than eight ideas, repeat the exercise
4. The group comes together and thinks about their favorite idea
5. Each person shares the top 2 or 3 ideas with the whole group
	1. Write 2-3 sentences or bullet points for each idea you describe
6. The best idea has to be elaborated through more sketches


## Design

### Create goals statements

#### Material needed
* Merge insights from:
	* Empathy maps
	* Personas
	* User Stories
	* User Journey Maps
* Get the problem statement, or at least
	* The who provided by the persona
	* The user story
	* The empathy map
	* The user journey map
#### Process/Template
* One or two sentences
* Identify a product
* Describe who the product will affect
* Describe the action the product allows the user to perform
* Describe how the action will affect positively the user / why it will solve their needs
* Describe how we will measure the action effectiveness
* Describe a product's benefits for the user
* Should cover:
	* Who the product is serving
	* What the product does
	* Why is it solving the users' needs*
* Template: _Our [product] will let users [perform specific actions] which will affect [describe who the action will affect] by [describe how the action will positively affect them]. We will measure effectiveness by [describe how you will measure the impact]._

![[Pasted image 20240403000239.png]]

### Create a storyboard

#### Elements
- Character: States the user in the storyboard
- Scene: A way to imagine the user's environment
- Plot: The solution or benefit offered by the design. 
- Narrative
	- Problem faced by the user
	- How the design will solve the problem. 

#### Process
1. Remind the problem statement
2. Identify the character and scene for the storyboard
3. Create the goal statement, which will give the context, beenfit or solution of the design
	1. A global sentence setting the narrative for the design at the top of the template. 
		1. Short sentence
		2. User problem + how the design is solving it
4. 6 panels
	1. One idea per panel
	2. Indicate how the user might feel
	3. Visual that demonstrate the UX with an app
	4. Highlight key moment in the user journey
	5. Include context and motivations
	6. Experience of successfully using the service
	7. Use captions for when interactions are difficult to sketch out. 

#### Types of storyboard

##### Big picture
- Focus on the user
- Communicate the environment or context
- Communicate the motivations for using the app (pain points, market opportunity)
- Focus on how people use the product and why is it useful to them. 
- Include pictures of emotions, sad or happy faces, at different moments of the journey
- What the user would need
- Why the product will be useful to the user
- User goal in the final panel
##### Close-up
* How the product works

### Create user flow
#### Definition
Path taken by a typical user on an app or website so that they can complete a task from start to finish. 

#### Components
* What actions willusers take
	* Represented as circles
	* Steps users must take to complete a task from start to finish
* What decisions will they make
	* Represented as diamonds
	* Users must ask a question and make a decision. 
	* Decision: Will move users forward or to an earlier part of the flow
* What screens will users experience after taking action or making a decision
	* Represented as rectangles
* Direction
	* Solid lines: Forward direction of the flow
	* Dotted lines: Backward direction for the flow.

#### Steps
2. Have a full understanding of users and their needs
3. You can also try to predict what the users will want. 
4. Consider the entire journey users take to get what they need. 
5. Reference the problem statement.
6. Decide the users tasks to map. 
	1. Choose an important task
	2. Use goal statements to identify a primary user task. 
7. Map the quickest and easiest way to get from entry point to task completion. 

### Create the information architecture

#### 3 pieces of IA
- Organization: how pieces of information connect in a product
- Hierarchy: Tree structure 
- Sequence: Sequence enables to move through an app via certain order of steps. 

#### 8 principles of IA
1. Object principle: Content is living and will grow over time. 
2. Choice principle: People want to have fewer choices but better organized. 
3. Disclosure: Information should not be unnecessary or unexpected
4. Exemplar principle: Humans put things into categories and group concepts
5. Front door principle: People will arrive at a homepage from another website
6. Multiple classification principle: People have different ways of searching information
7. Focused navigation principle: There must be a strategy and logic behind the way navigation menus are designed. 
8. Growth principle: The amount of content will grow over time. 
9. A website / app should be mapped in a hierarchical way

#### Specificities of mobile apps
- Not as many categories
- Mobile screens: Smaller
- Focus on the essential content
- Consider sizes and spacings
- Make sure the text will be large enough

#### Example of hierarchy
- Homepage
    - First point of entry of a user (e.g. welcome page)
    - Welcome page
        - New user login
        - Returning user login
        - Login with facebook or google
        - Product features
        - user settings
        - Pricing
        - Contact Us
        - Help
    - Settings
        - Profile
        - Security
        - Help
        - Policies
    - Help
        - Search for help topic
        - Browse topics
        - Contact us*
    - User Profile
        - Name
        - Email Address
        - Payment Details

### Create wireframes

#### Process
1. Review the research and storyboards
2. Review the user flow
3. Create multiple wireframes for the same screen of the app (5)
4. Timer of 2 minutes per variant. 
5. Come up with
	1. A structure for the page
	2. An intended function of each element on the page
6. Write a list of elements that need to be on the page
	1. Crazy eights
	2. Storyboard
	3. Research
7. Homepage
	1. Elements user will want to see
	2. Elements user will want to see often
8. Review wireframes
9. Add a star next to the pieces you like
10. Combine elements into a refined wireframe
11. Repeat steps until you have a refined wireframe for at least 5 pages

#### Criteria for a wireframe
* Defines the elements that should go inside the page
* Include multiple versions to arrange the elements
* Provides different examples to compare and test
	* Shapes 
		* Illustrations: Square or rectangle with an X
		* CTA: Rectangles or circles
	* Text: Horizonta lines

#### Digital wireframes
* Place the paper wireframe besides
* Use a grid
* Define a hierarchy (size, text weight, location)
* Experiment with visuals and spacing to ensure a pleasing design
* Focus on structure
* Think about the hierarchy of the information
* Build individual elements
* Repeat for each screen
* Arrange the wireframes in logical order to make it smoother

#### Best practices
- Start with a paper wireframe
- Add details digitally
- Let users know what they can do on the screen
- Leave only a few choices to the users
- Include only expected information
- Allow for different ways to search information¬†
- Think that the menus will grow over time
- Login / sign up screen
- Help, Settings (profile (name, email address, user profile‚Ä¶), security, help, policies‚Ä¶), help (search for help, browse topics, contact us‚Ä¶)

### Create a prototype

#### Paper prototype
* Paper prototypes help to make sure if elements are in the best location
* Use pre-printed templates
* Use cards (easy to add, reorder, remove...)
* Sticky notes: to call out important parts of the prototype
* Use stencils: Built in ruler and symbol
![[Pasted image 20240404215606.png]]

#### Digital prototype
* Ask what each interactive element needs to be connected to
* Each interactive element should be connected to something. 
* If an interactive element has nothing to connect
	* Take it away
	* Add a screen*
* Questions to ask
	* How are users going to interact with my product
	* What are common user flows through my product?
	* What buttons will users interact with?
	* What will users expect to happen after they click on a button a submit a form?
	* Did we connect all the wireframes required to complete the main user flow?
	* Did we provide a means to the user to go backwards and forward in the flow?
	* Are clues for navigation clearly indicated?
	* Did we return the users to a sample origin after they completed the activity
* Checklist
	* user flow of 3 screens
	* Define UI elements for each screen
	* Indicate the hierarchy of elements on the screen
	* Build elements
	* Think about the hierarchy of info
	* Most important elements are discoverable
	* Experiment with layout and spacing. 




### Design guidelines

#### Considerations for offline use
- Take the offline experience into account as well:¬†_ [Offline UX design guidelines](https://web.dev/offline-ux-design-guidelines/)


### Presentations
1. Objectives
2. Research questions
   For example for a competitive analysis: The features or characteristics that were compared across competitors.

	3. A rubric to indicate directly the grading system that will be used
6. Tips
	1. Get feedback from the team
	2. Limit the amount of text on the slides
	3. Focus on the highlights
	4. For more information, indicate in appendix
	5. Use outlines, or note cards
	6. Practice ahead of time
	7. Use relevant graphics
	8. Defend conclusions with actual data and specific examples whenever possible.
