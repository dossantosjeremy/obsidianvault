# How to use visuals on Product Landing Pages
## Make the viewer active
**Engagement:** Keeping visitors engaged is crucial to lowering bounce rates and increasing the likelihood of conversion. Interactive elements like 360-degree views, explainer videos, or image sliders can transform a passive viewer into an active participant.

## Create an emotional Connection
**Connection**: Establishing an emotional link with your audience can significantly affect their decision-making. Using visuals that trigger emotional responses—such as images of satisfied customers, impactful videos showcasing the effectiveness of a solution, or narratives that relate directly to user challenges helps build trust and credibility. These stories and testimonials capture the heart, making the logical appeal of your offerings even stronger.

## Use visual aids for clarification
**Clarification**: Visual aids are essential for conveying complex information in a digestible manner. Infographics, annotated screenshots, and brief informational videos can clarify what your product does and the specific problems it solves. This approach not only helps in simplifying the information but also in highlighting the key features and benefits of your products, making it easier for potential customers to evaluate their relevance and value.

## Comprehension
Enhancing understanding through a combination of textual and visual information can lead to better retention of the content. By supporting text with relevant visuals, you cater to various learning styles, making it easier for visitors to grasp and remember the information presented. This strategy is particularly effective in technical or feature-rich presentations, where visuals can demystify complex details.

## Direct users towards the expected action
**Direction:** Guiding users towards a specific action is a key function of visual cues on a landing page. Strategic use of arrows, color contrasts, and motion graphics can point visitors toward desired actions like signing up, making a purchase, or downloading a resource. Clearly highlighted call-to-action (CTA) buttons, especially when enhanced with visual elements like icons or animations, play a critical role in converting visitors into customers.
