### ‚ú® Summary
Building a successful business requires offering solutions that customers are willing to pay for, rather than just relying on ideas. This insight was learned through the creation of a payments business that made $15 million in revenue by simply offering lower commissions and listening to customer needs. The key lesson is to validate the market demand before building a business, ensuring that customers are willing to pay for the solution provided.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We disliked them strongly. You know, we could offer people a margin if we just did it ourselves. I discussed this with my business partner, Andrew. So I asked. Immediately, I called a few friends who owned Facebook games to see if they would switch to a different payment software if it offered lower commissions. Turns out, it was an easy sell. In a weekend, we put together a beta version of the site. And two weeks after that, we had the service called Gambit running. We instantly made our friends 20% more money by charging lower commissions and listening to them. In the first year, we ended up making more than $15 million in top line revenue. It was insane. The immediate success of this payments business that came from a moment of desperation, and in the wake of the failure of Betarcade, forced us to reckon with one of the most useful lessons Of business creation. It is deadly to build a business without first verifying that there are paying customers. Customers want solutions, not ideas. Customers do not care about your ideas. They care about whether you can solve their problems. And you should not build your idea into a business if you don't know with 100% certainty that it is a solution your customers will pay for. Trust me, I've done that.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Building a business without verifying paying customers can be deadly. Customers care about solutions to their problems, not just ideas. It is crucial to ensure 100% certainty that the idea is something customers will pay for before turning it into a business. Putting customers first before the product, service, or even the idea itself is key to business success.

I was so certain of my brilliant idea that I went ahead and built it. Except six months later and a hundred thousand dollars spent, they looked at what we delivered, said that however great it was, they did not need it right away and started ghosting me. That's why when it comes to generating business ideas, customers come first, before the product or service. Even before the idea. To build a business, you need someone to sell to.

Always ask for customer feedback and focus on their experience. Jeff Bezos and Steve Jobs emphasized starting with a customer-first approach. By working backwards from the customer, you can effectively identify your target market, the problem you are solving, and where they are located.

Working backwards prioritizes access to a group of customers, a group you probably belong to and focuses on an aspect of a customer's life that does not work. If you do it this way, you're assured of nailing the three W's of business right from the start. Who you are selling to, problem you're solving, where they are.</blockquote>

### [06:33] Moving from Nice to Have to Must Have


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (05:10 - 06:35)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/1c8c2555-f2cb-4433-817b-6c0db086a7a0)

### ‚ú® Summary
The key insight is to shift from offering products that are 'nice to have' (e.g., vitamins) to 'must have' (e.g., painkillers) to attract more customers. By observing successful strategies in one category (e.g., Macheist bundling Mac software), one can adapt and apply similar approaches to another category (e.g., non-Mac software). AppSumo's success in growing its email list was attributed to implementing giveaways.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Problem was, I had a series of businesses, like payments for social games, that had long sales processes that were hard to negotiate and my company was a commodity. I wanted to move up the value chain to a place where people can't live without my product. The problem I was most interested in solving was how do I get more customers? Everyone in business is interested in more customers. I didn't want to do another business where my product was a nice to have, a vitamin. I wanted to be a must have, a painkiller, and getting more customers is the most essential business need. One night I was thinking about a company called Macheiss that was offering bundles of Mac software at a steep discount. This was a great way for Mac users to get several useful apps at one really low price. And while I love a good deal, I couldn't stop thinking about how Macheiss had solved the problem of providing companies with customers. Every time Macheist bundled software and marketed the bundle, it was solving a need of those software companies, customers, and in turn those software companies were doing everything They could in terms of marketing and blogging to make sure the MacHeist bundle was a success. Could I do what MacHeist was doing but for non -Mac software? Pro tip, look for something working in one category and bring it to another. One of the largest drivers of AppSumo's email list was giveaways.</blockquote>

### [07:32] Innovation Through Cross-Category Inspiration

### ‚ú® Summary
To innovate, entrepreneurs should seek inspiration from different industries and adapt successful strategies to their own. This can involve observing giveaways in unrelated sectors, exploring web-based tools for efficiency, and creating discounted bundle deals outside of the usual market. Entrepreneurial success can be driven by solving personal challenges, as one's problems are likely shared by others, ensuring at least one satisfied customer.

One of the largest drivers of AppSumo's email list was giveaways. We realized this only after seeing a giveaway in a women's fashion online site and trying it out ourselves. Sign up for and observe companies outside of your target market for inspiration. As an entrepreneur, I'd come to rely on some of the flashy new web -based apps out there like Mailchimp, newsletters, Dropbox, storing files, and FreshBooks, accounting. With web -based software, it didn't matter what kind of computer you used as long as you had an internet connection. But no one was offering discounted non -mac bundles. Not yet. I was super excited to get my favorite tools at a discount. There were other startup founders like me. Tons! Now I had to find out the truth of whether people would pay me. Pro tip. When in doubt, solve your own problems. If you are willing to pay for a solution, it's likely others are too. And least you'll have one happy customer, yourself. I have always been active on Reddit, and I understood the community really well.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
When in doubt, solve your problems. If you're willing to pay for a solution, others probably are too. Understand your community, identify their needs, and create a solution they will pay for. Don't let others' doubts discourage you; the only opinion that matters is your customers'. Listen to their problems, provide a solution, and ensure they are willing to pay for it.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Pro tip. When in doubt, solve your own problems. If you are willing to pay for a solution, it's likely others are too. And least you'll have one happy customer, yourself. I have always been active on Reddit, and I understood the community really well. I knew what its users liked and how they interacted with the site. Working backwards, I zeroed in on something all Redditors love, sharing images. At the time, more and more were relying on a new site called Imgur to host their viral meme images. On Reddit's front page, every other post featured an image hosted on Imgur. While anyone could use Imgur for free, the company offered a pro subscription tier. Would these Redditors pay if I offered the pro tier at a deep discount? At this point, I went to my mentor from my Facebook days, Doug Hirsch, who later founded GoodRX to ask what he thought about the idea. He said it wouldn't work, that he didn't think there was enough software to make this a viable long -term business. Don't let doubt from another dissuade you from finding out the truth. The only opinion that matters is your customers. Your job as a customer first entrepreneur is to listen to the problem your customers want solved, create a solution to it, and validate they'll pay for it. No one else's.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Develop the simplest version of your offering and start selling it to gather feedback from actual customers. The MVP approach is crucial, but it must include a focus on customers who are willing to buy. Avoid the 'founder first' mentality and shift to a customer-centric approach. Prioritize conversation with customers to iterate the product based on their needs before investing further.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Instead of trying to develop something perfect and then unveiling it like Steve Jobs at MacWorld, you create the simplest possible version of what you're offering and start selling It right That way, instead of endlessly refining something in a vacuum, you use feedback from actual customers to incrementally develop and offering people absolutely want to buy In the real world. MVP is an important idea, but it leaves out something crucial. The customers. Who are you actually going to sell your minimum viable to? And what if they don't want the minimum? What if they're willing to try something only from a full -fledged company with a name brand? Good luck iterating on your MVP without customers. The problem with MVPs and older entrepreneurial approaches is we get so fixated on what we want to make that we lose sight of the people who want it. I call this the founder first mentality in which entrepreneurs focus on their own experience. Yeah, I get to build something instead of customer first. Old school, you focus on business model planning and obsessing about the product at the stage. New school, you're going to focus on the conversation with the customers, a dynamic back and forth that will help you iterate your product in terms of what the customer wants before You make or spend a thing. One more example to make sure this is totally clear.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Founders should reach out to friends, former colleagues, and communities in the early stages. Success can start by catering to a specific group's needs, demonstrated by Anahita who created a dog bakery for healthier snacks. Before picking an idea, ensure easy access to the people you want to help, such as new moms, cyclists, freelance writers, or taco lovers. Understanding your target group helps in effective communication and product testing.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>In the beginning, founders should reach out to their friends, their former colleagues, their communities. You may think your business is unique, but trust me, it's not. Every successful business can start this way. For example, Anahita loves her dogs and wanted healthier snacks for them. She started taking her homemade organic dog treats to her local dog park. She would sell out every time. A year later, she now has a store called The Barkery, a dog bakery. Before you even think about picking a idea, make sure you have easy access to the people you want to help. An easy way to do this is to think about where you have easy access to a targeted group of people whom you really want to help. Like say, new moms in Austin, cyclists, freelance writers, and taco obsessives, like me. Challenge. Top three groups. Remember, you can use your journal, which is free at milliondollarweekend .com to write these out. Let's write out your top three groups to target. Who do you have easy access to that you'd be excited to help? This can be your neighbors, colleagues, religious friends, golf buddies, cooking friends, whomever. The better you understand your target group, the better you can speak to them. The more specifically you can speak to their problems, the better and easier you can sell or test products. Note how this process prioritizes communication with people.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But no one was quitting coffee because there was nothing better to drink. Then Shane went to India and discovered masala chai. Shane loved it. It tasted great and gave him a small caffeine kick, but it didn't make him feel like a vibrating wreck like coffee did. So Shane invented mud water. His mud is masala chai coffee replacement with other ingredients for added health benefits. When he walked around with his mug of mud, people wanted to know what he was drinking, so he made some for his friends and it got them hooked. That tiny problem of his is now making over 60 million dollars per year. When you intentionally practice problem spotting, eventually it becomes something your mind just does automatically. It's become a game to me. A profitable one. Still stuck? Here are four questions to get you going. One. What is one thing this morning that irritated me? Two. What is one thing on my to -do list that's been there over a week? Three. What is one thing I regularly to do well? Four, what is one thing I wanted to buy recently only to find out that no one made it? I make it a habit to always keep a notebook close by and jot down things that bother me.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Now I thought of it. Until I was 30, I never had my own place, so my furniture has always been a weird collection of IKEA items. Really easy having a cool place when you're loaded. Not so easy, but possible when your budget is tight. Idea. Interior designers are for rich people. This business would be much simpler and less expensive. I send someone a photo of my place, giving my preferences, and they put together a Pinterest page of suggestions for me. Friend Activity Matchmaker How I thought of it. I love doing paddleboarding and going to the gym, but my friends aren't always available. Idea. Meetup is good for groups. But it'd be nice if some person or website could connect me with individuals to join me on these activities. Lately, I've been wanting new activity partners for things I'm doing. The website or service would be similar to Meetup, but more on the individual level. Challenge. Solve your own problems. Write down three ideas to solve those problems. 2. Bestsellers your best friends. What products are already selling a crap -ton, iPads, iPhones, etc. Basically any product you'd find on Amazon's best seller list would work here. How can you accessorize the product?</blockquote>
