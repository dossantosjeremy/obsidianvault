<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>New industries, new hobbies, new technologies, new roles, new people, new side hustles. That's where I found my superpower, taught me a lesson I wanna pass on to you. Focus above all else on being a starter, an experimenter, a learner. Pro tip, don't base your happiness or your self -worth on being the smartest, the most successful, the richest. Being so focused on the end result sets you up for a major because there is always going to be someone who's smarter, more successful, or richer, and every time you see that you've fallen Short, it will eat away at your motivation. Defining yourself by the things you do each day, the process, will get you to where you want to be quicker and more joyfully than measuring yourself against others. That's the wonderful thing about experimentation. Every experiment has within it the potential of unforeseen rewards that can change your life. But first, you've got to start. Challenge. The dollar challenge. Ask someone you know for a dollar investment in you and your future business, one measly dollar. This is your spark. Once you do this, you realize the power of starting and the simplicity of business, starting, asking, iterating.</blockquote>

You're the first person I thought of, and it would mean a lot to have your support. Can you send me one dollar right now? Your name. Oh no, I'm on the hook for this, you'll think.</blockquote>

### [16:35] Take Action First, Figure It Out Later

### ‚ú® Summary
Overthinking before taking action may seem smart, but it is less effective. Successful people act first, get real feedback, and learn from it, which is more valuable than any course or book. Acting first and figuring it out later is the key to success. Instead of planning excessively, just start acting to build confidence. Use the motto 'now, not how' to prioritize taking action immediately without worrying about the specifics. This habit can be instilled by shifting focus from overthinking to taking immediate action, leading to momentum and natural progression.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>After all, there are a ton of top -rated MBA programs, $10 Udemy courses, free YouTube videos, and entrepreneurship how -to books. So why wouldn't you learn all you could? That's got to be a whole lot safer and it probably makes you a lot less likely to fail, right? Wrong. Overthinking seems like the smart way to launch, but it is far less effective. Super successful people do the opposite. They take action first, get real feedback, and learn from that, which is a million times more valuable than any book or course, and quicker. Most people overthink first, act later. Every successful entrepreneur, act first, figure it out later. Any analysis ahead of action is purely speculation. You really do not understand something until you've done it. Rather than trying to plan your way into the confidence to act, just start acting. So how do you instill this habit if it doesn't come naturally? Use the motto, now, not how. Pro tip. Next time you are overthinking and not taking action, tell yourself to prioritize taking action now, and don't worry about the how. After you do this once, you will quickly get momentum and it becomes easier and more natural.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Recently, an ad agency was pitching our AppSumo team on a new Facebook advertising campaign.
