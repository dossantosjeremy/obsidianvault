> In this episode, I discuss skin health and appearance and why both are important indicators of the health status of your immune system, gut microbiome, and other organ systems. I explain why sunlight is essential for skin and hormone health and how excessive sunlight can accelerate skin aging and cause certain skin cancers. I discuss the different types of sunscreens (physical, chemical, and mineral-based) and potential health concerns of the chemicals found in some (but not all) sunscreens.<br/>>  I also discuss the importance of getting your skin (and not just moles) checked for pre-cancerous and cancer growths, the role of nutrition and lifestyle factors that improve skin health and appearance, and how to improve your skin by reducing local and systemic inflammation and supporting your microbiome.¬†<br/>>  I explain what works to improve your skin's youthfulness and appearance, including reducing wrinkles, sagging, and pore size. I review the data on ingesting (or topically applied) collagen, vitamin C, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and retinol, and what is known about the use of peptides (e.g., BPC-157, copper peptides) and red and far-red light phototherapies for improving skin health and appearance.<br/>>  I also discuss the causes of acne, rosacea, and psoriasis and explain nutritional, skin care, and prescription-based approaches to treating these common skin conditions.<br/>>  This episode ought to help everyone better understand the biology of the skin and help them make the best possible decisions for their skin health, care, and appearance according to age, goals, and current skin conditions.<br/>>  Access the full show notes, including referenced articles, books, people mentioned, and additional resources at  hubermanlab.com .<br/>>  Andrew's New Book   Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body :  https://protocolsbook.com <br/>>  Thank you to our sponsors  AG1:  https://drinkag1.com/huberman <br/>>  Joovv:  https://joovv.com/huberman <br/>>  BetterHelp:  https://betterhelp.com/huberman ¬†<br/>>  ROKA:  https://roka.com/huberman ¬†<br/>>  LMNT:  https://drinklmnt.com/huberman ¬†<br/>>  Timestamps  00:00:00 Skin Health<br/>>  00:02:59 Sponsors: Joovv, BetterHelp   Sunscreen<br/>>  00:19:51 Aging, Sun Exposure, Skin Cancers, Physical Barriers<br/>>  00:27:24 Sunburn   Tool: Low Glycemic Diet, Dairy<br/>>  02:07:26 Tools: Face Cleansing   Scarring & Popping Pimples<br/>>  02:13:29 Tool: Treating Rosacea, Alcohol, Skin Care, Nutrition<br/>>  02:18:31 Stubborn Rosacea, Over Cleansing, Pulsed Dye Laser<br/>>  02:21:04 Psoriasis Treatment, Immune System & Prescriptions<br/>>  02:25:24 Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify & Apple Follow & Reviews, YouTube Feedback, Protocols Book, Social Media, Neural Network Newsletter<br/>>   Disclaimer

### [48:19] Choosing Zinc Oxide Sunscreen


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (46:58 - 48:20)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/fb0c79dd-79bb-43c7-b505-b11f13661895)

### ‚ú® Summary
Using a sunscreen with zinc oxide as the only active ingredient, up to a 25% concentration, ensures safety while some may avoid it due to its sticky consistency. Combining titanium dioxide with zinc oxide makes the sunscreen silkier for better application. Chemical-based sunscreens are designed for a silky application, but they may contain components that pose health risks, such as being endocrine disruptors or mutagens.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, then find a sunscreen that is purely zinc oxide sunscreen. And again, they always have other things in them, but what I mean is the only active ingredient in a zinc only containing sunscreen is zinc oxide. And then there are a bunch of other things that allow it to be a lotion, for instance, again, up to 25% concentration. Why would somebody not want to use zinc oxide containing sunscreen up to 25% and opt for anything else? You might ask, right, if that's considered safe. The reason is the consistency of the zinc oxide is it's pretty sticky and thick and it's kind of pasty, right, back in the eighties and nineties. Some of you may recall that zinc oxide sunscreens that would actually, you know, color the nose white. So you could really see it was really prominent on the face. They tried to turn that into a fashion statement and didn't go over so well over time. But in any case, the addition of titanium dioxide to those zinc oxide containing sunscreens allow it to be a bit silkier so that it would spread on more evenly. And then you may say, well, why even put chemicals in sunscreen at all if there's risk? The reason why chemical -based organic sunscreens even exist is that they can come up with compositions of those sunscreens that are very silky even that could spread on clear over Makeup and things of that sort. But there are these concerns about some of those chemical components as endocrine disruptors and potentially as mutagens that could cause other issues or any number of different Things. You can find all sorts of concerns out there on the internet.</blockquote>

### [05:37] Entrepreneurship vs Trading: Understanding the Difference

### ‚ú® Summary
Entrepreneurship and trading are fundamentally different. Trading is a zero-sum game where there are winners and losers without room for value addition, making it challenging to beat the professionals. Unlike entrepreneurship, where value can be added, trading requires skill in timing to succeed.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>OK, but surely this is too good to be true. I've heard that like, you know, entrepreneurship is like, you know, 99% of startups fail or whatever that number is. I know so many people who bought a course on day trading, trying to make money online and like they've just failed and seems like the only people getting rich off of this are the people Selling the courses. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So what's going on there? OK, so great, great first frame. The first thing I'd say is entrepreneurship and trading are very, very different. Right. So trading is a zero-sum game. You're buying and selling equities or you're buying and selling a financial instrument. And these are zero-sum games. There's winners and losers and there's nothing in between or there's brokers in between. But you can't value out. You can't buy some shares or some currencies and value add those. You have to basically trade those and try and get in and get out at the right time. The reality is because it's a winner and lose a sport, something like trading, you are not going to beat the winners. Right. So the people who are the best in the world, it would be a silly for me to go into the NBA and say that I'm going to try and score a few points against the professional basketballers. I could try for 10 years. I wouldn't score a point, not one because they're professionals.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Entrepreneurship and trading are fundamentally different. Trading is a zero-sum game with winners and losers, making it difficult to compete against professionals. On the other hand, entrepreneurship allows for value addition and innovation, but it is challenging as most market needs are already met, making it less predictable for individuals entering the entrepreneurial space.

So that's who you're up against when you're in the trading space. So entrepreneurship is not trading. That is definitely not the case. When we go into the world of entrepreneurship, you can value add and you can do all of those sorts of things. Why is it that it's not more predictable for most people? Well, for starters, entrepreneurship, you're figuring out what the market wants. And most market needs already met. There's already businesses. There's millions of businesses. Yeah. So most market needs are already met. And people, it's like, yeah, I already have a company that makes great cupcakes. I don't need another cupcake company.</blockquote>

### [10:37] Understanding Entrepreneurship and Customer-Centric Approach

### ‚ú® Summary
Entrepreneurship involves aiming for commercial success and profit while taking risks with time, money, or others' money. Businesses focus on finding solutions that meet customer needs and provide the desired experience, as demonstrated by Porsche's approach of incorporating Pirelli tires and a quality stereo system based on customer preferences.


#### üìö Transcript
<details>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And to do that, they need tires and they need stereo system in the car. So what Porsche does is they ask, what does the customer actually want? What's the experience they're looking for? And how do we bring together everything that's required for that to happen? So they say, okay, let's get Pirelli tires on there and let's get a both stereo system in there and let's get two and a half thousand suppliers and let's pull them, bring them all together. So what businesses do is they find a solution to what the customer wants, what employees do, and especially when you've come out of school, is they have skills and they try and market The skills to an employer. So these are slightly different. They sound similar, but they're quite different. And that's why entrepreneurship feels a little bit different when you move from employment into entrepreneurship.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Nice. And how would you define entrepreneurship?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So entrepreneurship is a couple of things. Number one, you are trying to do something that commercially is successful. You want to make money. All right. So let's not beat around Bush. Entrepreneur, a big part of entrepreneurship is you want to make money. You're doing something for commercial success. It's, it's not a charity. You're trying to make a profit. The next thing is you're taking a risk. So entrepreneurship has an element of risk. And normally it's even at risk for the entrepreneur. You're in some way risking your time without a certain outcome or you're risking money or you're risking someone else's money. You're, you're, you're doing all of those sorts of things.</blockquote>

### [12:14] Entrepreneur versus Solopreneur

### ‚ú® Summary
An entrepreneur accesses resources beyond their control, enrolling others such as team members, investors, and customers. They influence people outside their current sphere. In contrast, a solopreneur operates alone, taking a risk without organizing significant human labor. The drawback of being a solopreneur is that the business halts if the individual goes on vacation.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And when you say, what was that thing you said? Sort of organizing resources.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So if you had all the resources, right, let's say you're a trust fund kid. You've got millions and millions of pounds already that your dollars that you're starting with and you've got all these people and it's, it's all there. You're essentially you're a leader. You're leading the money or your asset managing. An entrepreneur is normally someone who's accessing resources beyond their control. So they have to enroll other people to join their team. They have to enroll investors to put money in. They have to enroll customers to buy something that isn't really proven. So you're kind of influencing people outside of your current sphere.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And how would you define entrepreneur versus solopreneur? That's, you know, a thing that's become popular recently on Twitter and like one person business is and things like that. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So you're still commercial. You're, you're, you're still taking a risk. You're not really organizing a lot of human labor. You're not organizing people outside of your control. I'm not a big fan of solopreneur. And the reason for that is because if you're a quote unquote solopreneur, you're basically if you go on holiday, the whole business goes on holiday.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker highlights the risks of being a solopreneur, where one person is responsible for the entire business, creating a precarious situation where the business can suffer if the sole entrepreneur is unavailable. It is advised to scale the business by hiring salespeople, assistants, and customer service roles, enabling the entrepreneur to focus on high-value tasks. Managing up to 10 people is feasible for one individual before a management team becomes necessary, ensuring smoother operations and growth.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So you're still commercial. You're, you're, you're still taking a risk. You're not really organizing a lot of human labor. You're not organizing people outside of your control. I'm not a big fan of solopreneur. And the reason for that is because if you're a quote unquote solopreneur, you're basically if you go on holiday, the whole business goes on holiday. And you can imagine what it would be like if Microsoft said everybody's on holiday this month, we're all going away at the same time. Right. Microsoft would shut down and it would like the stock price would crash. So if you're a solopreneur and everyone goes away all at once, which is you, then that's a very precarious position. And the truth is you never really switch off as a solopreneur. So what you're trying to do is you're trying to like create something and sell something and deal with customers and all this sort of stuff all on your own. And the truth is, as soon as it starts showing sign of working, why wouldn't you have a salesperson? Why wouldn't you have an assistant? Why wouldn't you have someone who's, you know, customer service role? Why wouldn't you start bringing together a few people to make this thing actually a proper business and to also specialise your own time on the most high value thing that you do?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I mean, people famously say, oh, I don't want to manage people.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, I think managing people is when you go past, in some cases, six or seven people, sometimes you can manage up to like 12. But certainly once you go past 12, you are into management teams and all that sort of stuff. And it gets a hairier and more complex. Let's just call it 10 people. So under 10 people, you normally find that you're a self-organising team. Think about it like a dinner party. If you have six or seven people around for a dinner party, it really does self-organise.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The Chaos framework for entrepreneurship consists of Concept, Audience, Offer, and Sales. The first step is to create a concept, which involves deciding between a lifestyle business or a performance business. Understanding the type of business you want to build is crucial in the entrepreneurial journey.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>OK, nice. Cool. So apologies for taking us on a little bit of a tangent down that route. But I know that people are interested in the whole sort of prunner situation. So zero to 10 K a month. That's like our first step of the process. And so I wonder if, you know, this is something we tried on a previous podcast, if we can sort of pretend to be coaching me as a beginner to entrepreneurship. I don't really know anything about entrepreneurship, but I like the idea. Sure. I've maybe listened to you on Deep Dive with Ali Bala and I'm like, Oh, this Danny Priestley guy's like, you know, knows what he's talking about. I would like to engage his services as a coach. I know you don't really do want to want coaching anymore. But like how would we approach that conversation? If I were say working a full-time job as a junior doctor, two years out of med school. And I want to start a business, but like, I don't, I don't really know what's next.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I love a good framework and my framework for this would be chaos. Chaos stands for concept audience offer sales. So concept is we need to come up with something that is a good idea, a good concept. When people say, Ali, what on earth are you doing? Why are you quitting your job to do this thing? They're going to say, what are you, what is it going to do? What are you going to start? So the first thing is you've got to have a good answer to that. So you've got to have a concept. So let's talk about concept. And I want to do this nice and quick, but do it justice. So the first thing that I want to do with the concept is I want to know, do you want a lifestyle business or a performance business? Right? What are we building? What does that mean?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Starting the entrepreneurial journey involves transitioning from chaos to success through the Chaos framework which stands for Concept, Audience, Offer, and Sales. The first step, zero to 10K a month, sets the foundation. Even without entrepreneurship knowledge, coaching as a beginner requires understanding the process and seeking guidance from experienced mentors like Danny Priestley with a focus on practical steps for business development. Transitioning from a full-time job as a junior doctor to entrepreneurship involves defining a clear framework and seeking expert advice for the next steps in the entrepreneurial journey.

### ‚ú® Summary
When developing a business concept, the Chaos framework can be applied, which stands for Concept, Audience, Offer, and Sales. The concept phase involves determining if the business will be a lifestyle business focused on enjoyment and freedom, or a performance business aimed at growth and scalability. A lifestyle business is kept small for fun and flexibility, while a performance business aims for high valuation, growth, and is open to investors and debt. Understanding the desired outcome - a dream home or a 10-story building for sale - is crucial in shaping the business concept.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I love a good framework and my framework for this would be chaos. Chaos stands for concept audience offer sales. So concept is we need to come up with something that is a good idea, a good concept. When people say, Ali, what on earth are you doing? Why are you quitting your job to do this thing? They're going to say, what are you, what is it going to do? What are you going to start? So the first thing is you've got to have a good answer to that. So you've got to have a concept. So let's talk about concept. And I want to do this nice and quick, but do it justice. So the first thing that I want to do with the concept is I want to know, do you want a lifestyle business or a performance business? Right? What are we building? What does that mean? So a lifestyle business is going to be, are we keeping it small so that you can have fun, freedom and flexibility? Is that the purpose? Do you want to just travel and work and, um, and have a little, you know, gang of people that, uh, you know, rebels and misfits and we keep it small and deliberately the whole purpose is Fun, freedom, flexibility, and especially we don't want debt or investors. Right. So that would be a lifestyle business, lifestyle beauty. And, um, the second thing would be a performance business, which is we're building something to sell it. We want to become big and valuable. We want to be 50 million, a hundred million plus in valuation. We want 50 employees. We're happy to take on investors. We want investors. We want debt. Um, we want to build something that's going to be valuable. So the first thing I'd want to know is do you want a lifestyle business or do you want a performance business? I think of it like a property developer with a block of land. Do you want to put your dream home on the block of land or do you want to build a 10 story building and sell it?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The choice between a lifestyle business focused on fun, freedom, flexibility, and avoiding debt or investors, and a performance business aimed at growth, high valuation, taking on investors and debt, is crucial. A lifestyle business is like building a dream home on a property, while a performance business is akin to constructing a 10-story building to sell. Starting with a lifestyle business is common, and progressing to a performance business may require experience and guidance. Defining the Origin, Mission, and Vision based on one's background is essential for aligning with the business goals.

Right. So, and this is not a bad place to start. Normally a performance business is something that you would do. Um, if you've got really good guidance and, and you know, you might have, it might be your second time through. So, um, that would be the first thing. The next thing I'm looking at is what we call OMB, Orange, Origin, Story, Mission, and Vision. So what is your background? And we need to do something that lines up with your background.</blockquote>

### [20:29] Entrepreneurial Roots in Childhood Empowerment


[üéß Play snip - 2minÔ∏è (18:44 - 20:30)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/ce710754-502b-4fa5-8e93-5adbea6b350c)

### ‚ú® Summary
Entrepreneurs often trace their roots of empowerment back to childhood, typically around age 10 to 13, when they first realized their independent power separate from their parents. This empowerment moment could involve standing up to a bully, taking ownership of a project, or creating something independently. Psychologically, entrepreneurs are driven to recreate this feeling of empowerment. Early experiences of coding and creating websites without permission can symbolize this empowerment, echoed in later entrepreneurial endeavors that involve technology, creation, and self-expression without needing validation or permission from others.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>If I had time with that person, I would discover that around age 10, there were moments where there were the early moments of empowerment. Now I've worked with enough entrepreneurs to discover that always around age 10 to 13, there was a moment where you discovered that you were actually independently powerful separate To your parents. Um, and you have a moment of like, wow, okay. You know what? I'm not just a dumb kid. I've actually, there's something going on here. So you might have stood up to a bully. You might have, um, taken ownership of something you might have, you know, put together a little play, something like that. So there's always clues in that. Um, and psychologically, one thing I've found about entrepreneurs is that they're at a very deep level, they're trying to get back to that feeling, that feeling of empowerment. And it started early. So let me ask you the question around age 10 to 13. Do you remember a particular early memory where it was like, I had a moment of empowerment, I had a moment that feels like, wow, I'm, I'm on my own and I'm actually a powerful individual. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>It was when I started to learn to code. Coding. Yeah. And when I started baking websites and the joy, I'm, I can't be wrong. I'm kind of getting emotional for like, even just talking about it, just the joy of creating something without my mom's permission and like just making the thing. Yeah. And then started like advertising my services on a freelancer website back back in the day. So there's some elements here of technology.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And there's some elements of putting stuff out to the world. Like you're actually creating something and putting it out to the world. And there's elements of like no permission. Right. Now if we go and fast forward to YouTube, it's a no permission platform. You're creating something for the world and you're putting it out there in the world. So there's all these kind of echoes of that early memory.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The act of creating without permission, such as coding or baking websites, can instill joy and a sense of independence. This early experience can shape a person's initiative, as seen in examples like offering services on a freelancer website or creating content for platforms like YouTube. These experiences, whether positive or negative, form a foundational moment in an individual's life, influencing their path and approach to challenges.

So what happens is that this ingrains in us pretty early and everyone's got one. Right. So we all have a moment. Sometimes it's a negative experience. So sometimes like a silly example, the origin story for Batman is he's a victim of crime. His parents are killed and he realizes that he is on his own. Right. And he has to figure it out real fast on his own that he's now a 10 year old kid who's orphaned. Right.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The pursuit of a passion involves both literal and emotional elements, such as performing in front of others or creating and selling a physical product. It does not have to be limited to a specific field like music, but can encompass various aspects like lifestyle, business, and making an impact on the world. When exploring one's passion, it is essential to consider one's origin (background), vision (future aspirations), and mission (current high-value focus).

### ‚ú® Summary
In business, having a clear vision entails understanding one's background and what one aspires to achieve in the future, encompassing lifestyle, performance, and impact on the world. Conversely, the mission focuses on the current high-value activities necessary to reach the desired vision. An analogy to World War II distinguishes vision as the end goal and mission as the immediate, crucial tasks. For a business, vision guides the long-term objectives, while mission determines the present high-impact priorities. A clear mission, like developing entrepreneurs to create positive impacts, ensures that one is delivering substantial value in business.

### ‚ú® Summary
To create a successful business concept, focus on solving a problem and finding customers who are willing to pay for that solution. It is crucial to consider not only passion but also profitability. Many people devote time to solving problems, but running a successful business requires appealing to those who have the financial means to pay for solutions. Avoid targeting markets, like students, who are more inclined to invest time than money. The key is to identify problems that wealthy clients are willing to pay to resolve, rather than focusing solely on creative ideas.

They're not, they got no money to throw at it.

### ‚ú® Summary
The key to a successful product is delivering a significant return on investment to customers. Products with a 10 to one return ratio are attractive as they offer substantial benefits. For instance, YouTube Academy is perceived as worth 10 to one as it provides opportunities to earn money, secure sponsorships, build personal branding, and create lasting digital assets. When developing business ideas, it is essential to outline the potential return for customers. Testing business ideas involves creating a page of notes outlining the idea and then implementing methods such as intro events, quizzes, and WhatsApp groups to gauge interest and viability.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>One of the, one of the great questions is like, does this product deliver someone a return? Like what's the return on investment for them? And if there's, if there's like a 10 to one, if you can think about a 10 to one return, it normally is going to be a good people are going to pay for it. Yeah. So, um, YouTube Academy clearly is worth 10 to one. All right. If I start a YouTube channel, um, and it succeeds, I'm going to earn money. I've got sponsorship opportunities. I'm going to build a personal brand. It's going to create digital assets that last forever. There's all these positives that could easily be defined as a 10 to one ratio. So whatever I spend, there's a great return and it's nice and clear that there's a, there's a nice return. So, um, a lot of good products, you can actually explain how it returns.

So we're going to talk about what's the product going to look like, whom, who might it before, um, those sorts of things, but then pretty quickly, we want to test that. So I've got three ways that I like to test ideas. I like to run an intro event, which is purely and simply just an introduction to blank. Um, I like to run a quiz, which is, um, uh, are you ready to blank answer 10 questions and find out on score app? Um, and I like to do a WhatsApp group.

You would start by doing a first up, you would do a little event and it would be any introduction to productivity hacks. Um, and it would be 30 people on a zoom call. Yeah. And you would present four or five productivity hacks and see if you can get 30 people. Um, and that's, that's test number one. Test number two is, are you ready to be more productive? Take the scorecard, um, answer 10 questions and find out if you could be improving your productivity. Right. So a three minute, a three minute productivity assessment. How's your personal productivity? Answer the score app scorecard. Boom. Uh, now what happens then is if you can get 150 people to fill that in, that's a good sign. Doesn't cost you much to set that up. Mm. So now you're actually getting validation. And then the third test is, um, productivity hacks. What's app group?

### ‚ú® Summary
The J-Curve concept in business indicates the shape of cash flow: initially losing money, then breaking even, and finally making a profit. Businesses that make sales of over a thousand dollars at a time are typically non-J-Curve businesses, while volume businesses are often J-Curves. In a sales business, making a sale and fulfilling it for over a thousand dollars each time signifies a non-J-Curve business.

Uh, what is a J-Cove business and why would you advise against doing this?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>The J, the J stands for the shape of the cash flow. So it stands for losing money, losing money, losing money, or not losing so much, not losing so much. Oh, we're making money. We're making money. We're making a lot of money. Right. So that's the J. So there are certain businesses that are sales businesses that are not J-Cove's. And then there are businesses that are volume businesses that are typically J-Cove's. Okay.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Sales versus volume.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So if it's a sales business, it's normally making a sale of over a thousand pounds or over a thousand dollars at a time. Um, so for example, if I pick up the phone and talk to you and say, um, uh, Ali, I do studio setups and, um, we actually come in and we do all the microphones and we do all the setup and we actually Set you up a whole podcast studio and video production studio and we have a studio management service and it's $7,000 to do, to do all of this stuff for you. You say, yes, you sign an agreement. Yes, I want that. And then I go away and actually bring all the stuff and I get all the things that I promised you and I can literally take that agreement and then go off and, and, uh, get the microphones and All that stuff that I need after you've signed. So I'm making a sale and then I'm fulfilling the sale and each sale is more than a thousand dollars.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Proper businesses aim to generate at least $10,000 a month through a clear and feasible sales model.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Uh, yes, you can, but it's not going to be a massive, you're not going to sell that for, you know, you might sell some courses. You could. Yeah. These are not the kind of businesses I get excited about. You know, these are, these are the hobby, hobby businesses. Do you want to talk about hobbies or proper businesses? I think let's go. Proper businesses. So proper businesses, we want to get to 10,000 a month. We want here's what, here's what my rule would be. Five sales of two grand. Is it feasible that we can do five sales of two grand? So if we're going to do guitar lessons and we're not, um, it would have to be that we're signing up people for a commitment of 200 a month times 12 months. And we're doing like family guitar lessons and we come around and we have a guitar teacher who comes into your house and does the thing and it's 200 a month and it's a minimum 12 month commitment. Okay. Fine. Uh, now we're in two grand packages. Can we make five sales of that per month?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Then delivering on that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, then yeah, we knew. We need guitar teachers. Right? Not very scalable. We could be. I don't know how many guitar teachers are out there. Yeah. All right. But maybe, um, so, but that would be the only way that it would meet my criteria. I have to see that I can make a good 10 grand a month. There has to be a clear model, a, a back of a napkin spreadsheet that just says, yeah, we, if we make this many sales, it's sensible that we can get to 10 grand a month. Pretty quickly with like one or two people, like me and, and me and a friend we could get to 10 grand a month. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Damn. Okay.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And it's good to be damn. It's good to go. Oh, that rules a bunch of stuff out. Yes, it does.</blockquote>

Oh, well, what does it do? How does it work? Well, here's what it does and here's how it works and we can build these.

I might be thinking either web design agency type situation potentially, but I've kind of been outside of that market for a while, or I'd be thinking video content. Just quickly. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You've been outside of that market. Do you know someone who's credible web development? Do you know someone who's a web developer? Yeah. Yeah. Sell them. Hmm.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, that could work. Actually, in my head, it was defaulting to, oh, I guess I'd have to do it myself. So I need to learn quite a lot of stuff. No, you don't.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You can find someone who's good at web development and you can just go running around selling to grand packages for them to build. Ooh. Okay. That could work too. There you go. There's 10 grand a month.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>What if I was like, hey, I know how to use a camera. I know how to do video editing. Therefore, if I do personal brand video content for startup founders, who I know have money or business owners like you who I know have money and I could be like, Dan, you have books. You want to be on all the content to social platforms. I'll show up to your house once every month and we'll film a bunch of stuff. I'll ask you the questions. I'll chop it up content for Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn, et cetera, et cetera.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I'm out. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I'm rock and roll. Yeah. Of course.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So that's a great example. Yeah. And you just sign me up and you might say it's initially two grand and see if you like it, then it's two grand a month after that. Now you might say, by the way, I've got whole team.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The key role of an entrepreneur is to be the organizing force and not personally engage in tasks such as web development or video editing. By delegating tasks to specialized teams across different locations like the UK, the Philippines, and Ghana, entrepreneurs can focus on orchestrating operations and bringing together diverse content for platforms like TikTok. Successful entrepreneurs emphasize the importance of delegation and forming a strong team to execute tasks efficiently.

And you just sign me up and you might say it's initially two grand and see if you like it, then it's two grand a month after that. Now you might say, by the way, I've got whole team. I've got an amazing team of people. I've actually found I've got lead content creators here in the UK. I've also got an international team so that we can do an initial style guide and some signature content. And we can also do brute force content, you know, through our team in the Philippines. And we've got a team in the Ghana and actually we send all the full or footage to them and they create lots of videos and we then put that on TikTok and all that sort of stuff. We see what sticks and bring it all together. I'm like, whoa, that sounds really great. So yeah, that would be like I'm really big on the idea of the entrepreneur's job is to be the organizing force not to do the work. So like you keep getting into like, Oh, I know how to edit videos. It's like, it's like that's doing the work. You're not being an entrepreneur. You're being in a video editor. So the entrepreneur's job is to be the organizing force. You're the organizer. I don't know how to do anything. Like just just just on that. I've built multiple $10 million plus companies. I don't know how to do anything. Like as in, I don't have any web development skills. I don't have video editing skills.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Professionalism in sales entails asking great questions, providing guided advice, having product knowledge, listening, and making sensible recommendations. Sales is a valuable skill involving listening, understanding, creating persuasive arguments, and bridging the gap between the customer's current reality, desired reality, and existing obstacles.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Almost everyone's had a positive experience with a sales person and a negative experience with a sales person. But that could be true for any profession. I've had negative experiences with bookkeepers. I've had negative experiences with lawyers. I've had negative experience with doctors fairly. There are good doctors and bad doctors. There's people who've got amazing bedside manner and people who are really not that great. So when it comes to sales, the word that everyone says about a good sales person is professional. They were professional. They approached it professionally. So what does professional mean? It means that they ask great questions. They give you guided advice. They are not pushy, but they also do give guidance. They've done their homework. They've done their research. They've got great product knowledge. They listen. They understand they're trying to get on your side to figure out what it is you actually genuinely need and they're making sensible recommendations. So all of those things are professionalism. So sales is a science and it's a very valuable skill that you can use in any profession. It doesn't matter what you are or what you do. A sales skill is a powerful skill because sales is listening, understanding, and then creating a good argument for the right solution and being able to marry up. This is what you're trying to achieve. This is what I think you need. And here's why. Right. So you're creating a path of least resistance. Here's the mental model you should have with sales. There is the current reality that the person has. That is their current situation. There is their desired reality. That's what they want. And then there's the obstacles and criteria that are in the way. Right. These are all the things that stop them from getting what they want.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Entrepreneurship should be pursued out of passion and the desire to bring something valuable to life. Earnings of around 10,000 a month in entrepreneurship equate to a basic job after deducting overhead costs. However, entrepreneurship comes with extra work, stress, and the risk of the business collapsing if you stop, making it a challenging but rewarding endeavor.

You do it because you spot something in the world that you want to bring to life. You want to do this thing. And it's like you go in eyes wide open. But look, I will say this, they're the upside with entrepreneurs. While entrepreneurship is wild if you get it right. Like, so 10,000 a month is where you kind of like 10,000 a month is where you're on par with a basic job. Because you're going to have a few overheads. So, you know, if you take a basic job and you say, okay, four or five grand a month, like NHS doctor, is that would they be on about five grand a month? Yeah, four or five. Okay. So, you know, if you're okay, depending on what level, but yeah. Yeah. So essentially that 10 grand a month of sales minus an assistant, minus some costs of doing business is going to leave you with about four or five grand a month. So if you can do that, you're on par with a job, but you've got extra work, extra stress. And if you stop, the whole thing stops. So you're kind of like just benchmarking. You know, those games where there's like a shadow person and you're trying to keep up with that shadow person. So at 10 grand a month, you're kind of like neck and neck with your employed shadow person at that stage. Nice.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The essence of capitalism lies in the mutually beneficial exchange where each party values what they receive more than what they give. In the example of a coffee transaction, the coffee shop gains more utility from receiving money than keeping the coffee, while the buyer gains more utility from having the coffee than keeping the money. This mutual benefit leads to both parties being happy and content with the transaction, reflecting the essence of all economic exchanges.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And I know rationally that like, yeah, capitalism and money is the most pure and brilliant transaction. It's the most incredible system. The, the marginal utility of a cup of coffee for a coffee shop owner is really low. They don't want that cup of coffee. Right. The marginal utility of the coffee for the person who doesn't have a cup of coffee is high. And the marginal utility of their two pounds, 50 or three dollars is low. So everyone wins. Isn't that incredible? Like, think about that just for a moment. The coffee shop owner is so happy that you gave them three dollars for the coffee. You're so happy that they have this coffee shop and that they were just willing to give you this delicious coffee and for three dollars and you're like, I didn't want the three dollars. I didn't care. There's my three dollars. Yay. Hot cup of coffee. Fantastic. And, and then they're like, yay, I got three dollars. I didn't need that extra cup of coffee. So this is the beauty of business that you essentially have two people who are super happy, super stoked. So this is what every transaction involves. Every single transaction that happens in the economy is two people who felt that they want two people felt that they walked away going, that is so great.</blockquote>

And then how do we go to 100k a month? You're right. That seems like bloody hell of a million. Yeah, exactly. You're either two to four people at this point. So 10 grand a month is normally a two person, three or four people. So two to four people typically. You normally would have a salesperson.

Creating a unique offering tailored to the niche market, such as online personal branding and web strategy for doctors, sets the business apart from competitors. This strategy increases client interest, allows for higher pricing, and differentiates the business within the market.

And then me as the web designer, as the entrepreneur behind the web design agency, I need to become a key person of influence in the web design world.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So now you're standing up on stages and you're saying, Hey, look, we are specialists in working with dentists and we sponsor all the dental practices and we're on all the dental podcasts</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And we do web strategy for dentists.

And now you build out your little team and now it's five grand plus the recurring revenue is starting to stack up. You're now making 10 sales a month, 20 sales a month. So you do say four sales a week, 16 sales times five grand. So now it's 80 grand a month. That's 12 months. That's a million. Okay.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
When developing a personal brand, it is crucial to maintain a balance between creating products for the existing market and exploring new ventures. Similar to the Eiffel Tower, the real profit does not come from the main attraction but from the ecosystem around it. A successful personal brand should focus on being the central figure while having a range of products and services surrounding it to maximize revenue.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>What's the balance? Okay. So let's make a concrete with our YouTube Academy, for example. Um, what's the balance between? Let me stay in my lane and just keep on making more products for my existing market of people wanting to start a YouTube channel versus, you know what? I'm kind of known for productivity. Let me start a productivity app.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So people are willing to go on a journey with you, provide it. It's okay to have a product ecosystem. Yeah. So I want to, I want you to think about yourself. I know this all sounds strange. Imagine you're like the Eiffel Tower. Okay. But how does the Eiffel Tower make money? Actually, the real money is made in all the things around the Eiffel Tower. So when people go to hotels, restaurants, cafes, museums, galleries, that's all stuff that's around the Eiffel Tower. So people are attracted to the Eiffel Tower, but there's all the things around the Eiffel Tower that make all the money. The, like very few people go to Paris and drop all their money on like a trip up to the Eiffel Tower and back. That's like, yeah, 15 credits. No, they like to be around it. They like to see it. They don't, you know, they don't actually expect to spend all that much money on it. But this is what a personal brand should be like. A key person of influence should be the Eiffel Tower and they should have a product ecosystem around them, me personally.</blockquote>

## Episode AI notes


1. Types of Compensation: Jobs, Careers, and Businesses. Start with a job to get paid to learn, aim for a career where your performance is valuable, and transition to a business where you leverage others' time and performance for money.
2. Build Sustainable Income Before Quitting. Prioritize building sustainable income from a side hustle before quitting your job. Lean on the security of your job to continue learning and use extra time efficiently.
3. Efficiency Over Time and Money. Focus on efficiency and motivation rather than simply relying on having more time or resources. More time or money does not inherently change behavior; it magnifies existing habits.
4. Maximizing Time and Effort for Business Success. Focus on leveraging limited time effectively to address business bottlenecks and drive growth. Dedicate more time to side hustles if your full-time job drains energy.
5. Balancing Work and Life for Productivity and Success. Generating positive emotions leads to higher energy levels and productivity. Work-life balance enhances performance and helps achieve success.
6. Three Questions to Evaluate New Opportunities. Evaluate new opportunities based on potential failure, long-term upside, and commitment to benefit from gains. Pursue opportunities with positive outcomes and compounding benefits.
7. The Two Year Test Framework. Share insights from two years ago or look ahead two years to create valuable content. Document the journey of learning and teaching to continuously progress.
8. Iterate and Scale Through Live Feedback. Gather live feedback to refine products and attract users. Continuous refinement based on feedback is crucial for product success and growth.
9. Identifying and Addressing Bottlenecks. Address bottlenecks that limit overall progress to improve efficiency. Focus on improving the slowest part of the process for optimal performance.
10. Choose Platform Based on Preference and Problem. Address a specific problem for a targeted audience on a chosen platform to achieve success. Focus on solving a valuable problem that people are willing to pay for.
11. Reverse Engineering Million Dollar Revenue. Reverse engineer revenue goals to break down daily sales requirements and identify necessary steps for success. Launch scalable products to efficiently reach revenue targets.
12. Value Over Time. Investing in expensive courses or masterminds saves time and provides guidance for immediate returns. People pay for value, guidance, accountability, and support to put information into action.
13. Identifying and Addressing Health and Fitness Bottlenecks. Identify obstacles hindering health goals and address them for successful achievement. Addressing ignorance is often the first step in achieving goals.
14. Knowing vs Doing in Personal Improvement. Understand what actions to take for personal development and address reasons behind inaction. Knowing what to do and why you are not doing it are crucial for improvement.
15. Setting Goals: Direction, Clarity, and Next Steps. Set clear goals with a direction, evaluate your current position, and identify the next step forward. Utilize bottleneck thinking to move towards your goals.

### ‚ú® Summary
There are three types of compensation: jobs where you trade dollars for hours, careers where you trade performance for dollars, and businesses where you trade other people's time and performance for money. Start with a job only if you are getting paid to learn, then aim for a career where your performance is valuable to the business and you are hard to replace.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So there are three types of ways to be compensated in the world. You have jobs, careers and businesses. So job, you trade dollars for hours. So you show up, you're a Starbucks barista, you get paid $12 and you get them some of your time. A career is similar, but you're trading performance for dollars. So you are in some way generating revenue for the business, whether that's through sales or whether that's through highly productive work that legitimately, if they fired you, that Business would make less money and you're harder to replace. And then you have a business, which is you're trading other people's time and performance for your own money. So in the beginning, you should only ever work a job where you're trading time for money if you are getting paid to learn. So you need to be learning skills during that time. A career you should stick with and try to get to as quickly as possible. So first step, don't quit your job, but try to get into a career versus a job.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Prioritize building sustainable income from a side hustle before quitting your job to pursue your passion. By staying employed and pushing financial risk, you are forced to think long term and build something lasting. Lean on the security of your job to continue learning and use the extra time efficiently. Focus on intensifying efforts on your side hustle in limited hours, rather than quitting prematurely and wasting time on unnecessary work.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I was like, this is all going to go away. No way this thing is real. I had to really prove to myself. So I was like two or three times as much where I was now more of a personal financial risk for me to stay rather than to leave. And I'm grateful for that because I was patiently waited. I really built something sustainable rather than, hey, I just need to get to two times and then I'm going to squeeze all the juice out of this and then I'm going to quit my job and then then What? No, so I forced you to force you to think long term. And so I say two times as much, sustainably for three to six months before you quit, which I think goes against most people's advice. Like you got to burn the ships and you got to go only and on your passion. It's like, no, lean on that security a little bit of the job you have. Make sure you're still learning something and then use the extra time because to be honest, you have a lot more time than you think if you brought the level of intensity that I think is Required to build something on the side and you're going to force yourself to be more efficient because you only have that many hours. Whereas if you were to quit and I found this out of the hard way when I did eventually quit, I thought, Oh, I have all this time now. I'm going to go and make way more. It's like, no, you just find work that you probably shouldn't have been doing in the first place. Yeah. So instead take that Parkinson's law of I only have four hours a day, two hours before work, two hours after. And I have to get this thing to two times income. What does that look like?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Having more time or money does not inherently change behavior; it only magnifies existing habits. If someone lacks energy to work on a side hustle after their day job, quitting the job may not lead to increased productivity. It is important to focus on efficiency and motivation rather than simply relying on having more time or resources.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Okay. I know a lot of people who are doing the side hustle thing on the side and they say, Oh, I get home from work and I just have no energy. I just cannot bring myself to like grind on the side hustle. But if I quit my job, I would have all this spare time and I've got savings and I can dip into my savings if I need to. And people say you should invest in business, right? So like, you know, you could quit and it's like all this, all this kind of stuff. What would you say to the person who says, man, I'm so knackered working my day job, but I get home and I have no energy and I just have to flop in front of the TV and watch Netflix. And I think I have the mental energy to do at that point.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Time and money are similar in that most people think having more of it will change your behavior, but it's just going to expose and amplify your bad behaviors. So if you were inefficient and unable to be energized enough to work two hours before and two hours after work, more than likely when you have the full day to work on that thing, you're Still not going to be able to do what you think you're going to.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Oh, it's tough love.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Having more time does not necessarily result in more money. It's crucial to focus on leveraging limited time effectively to address the key business bottlenecks and work on tasks that drive business growth. If your full-time job drains your energy, it's a sign to dedicate more time and effort to your side hustle as a step towards eventually transitioning out of the draining job.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>If you have all day, you're not going to make 10 times as much more. And that's where people go wrong is they think, oh, if I had 10 times more time, I'd make 10 times as much money. Not true. You have to be thinking, how can I get the most out of those four hours? How can I deploy those in a high leverage way where because you have less time, you're not going to do all this superfluous stuff that you end up doing when you have all day. Yeah. So I got four hours. What is the highest single usage of that time to move the business forward? Yeah. It forces you to only address the bottleneck of your business at any given time. Yeah. I need to go build a logo and I need to have this perfectly optimized blog post page. It's like, no, I have three hours today before I got to go sell my soul again. What am I going to go work on that's going to help me eventually escape this? Yeah. There's no time for waste. There's no time for any of that. So this goes back to an overarching problem that if you don't have the energy to spend three hours working on a side hustle because you're tired from your full time job, is exactly why You should go spend six hours working on your side hustle. Because if your full time job is tiring you out that much, you have to get out of there. Yeah. But you can't just quit because then you're completely on your own. So it's even more important. So you should instead look at it like a indicator of, if I'm this tired, it means I'm spending eight hours of my day getting my energy zapped by this full time job vampire. I need to do everything I can, which is going to take an uncomfortable amount of effort and intensity.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The key principle highlighted in this discussion is that generating positive emotions leads to higher energy levels and increased productivity. The concept is that by feeling good and maintaining a balance between work and personal life, individuals can enhance their performance, have more energy for side projects or relationships, and ultimately achieve success. The speaker emphasizes that successful individuals had to go through intense phases of hard work before achieving work-life balance and that attempting to build a business while prioritizing health, relationships, and self-care simultaneously is unrealistic.

### [21:05] Three Questions to Evaluate New Opportunities


[üéß Play snip - 1minÔ∏è (19:38 - 21:07)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/10499bc8-bc97-424b-8129-521366f8435d)

### ‚ú® Summary
When considering new opportunities such as a side hustle or writing on the internet, evaluate based on three questions: Is there no way this is a failure with a positive outcome even in the worst-case scenario? Is there exponential upside potential if you stick with it long-term? Can you commit to sticking with it to benefit from compounding gains? If all three questions can be answered positively, the opportunity is worth pursuing.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So in one case, you do need the cost of an action to be high enough where you show up when you don't want to. But then on other days, you need to design whatever it is you're doing in a way that is fulfilling and you are growing in the process. So I like to think of when you're evaluating a new opportunity, you should think about three questions before you say yes to it. So if you're thinking about building a side hustle or thinking about writing on the internet or whatever it is you're evaluating, to be able to answer three questions. One, is there no way that this is a failure? And when I ask that, it's, is there upside no matter what happens? So I'm going to use the example of writing on Twitter. The downside if I wrote every day for a month was that I better understood the podcast that I listened to. Is that downside? No, zero. So when I took on that 30 day writing challenge, when I took on the year long newsletter, it was the downside is there is none. Worst case I learned. So you should have a worst case scenario that is still a positive outcome. Second, you need exponential upside if you are able to stick with it for the long term. So exponential upside if it works out. So writing on newsletter, writing on Twitter, that's exactly what happened. I unlocked that exponential upside. And then third, you need to be able to stick with it. Can I stick with this long enough to see the benefits of compounding? If you can say yes to all of those, so there's no downside, I still learned something. There's exponential upside.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Committing to a two-year duration allows the benefits of compounding to be realized. When evaluating a new endeavor, ensure that it aligns with your capacity for sustained commitment. Packaging existing work with minimal additional effort for exponential potential upside is a key strategy. Avoid ventures that require excessive new research or effort on top of existing obligations.

So I think that way, when you're evaluating something, don't get into it. If you know that you couldn't stick to it for two years, was I going to be able to write a newsletter every week? I sure hope so. I sure hope I could spend three hours and I designed it in a way that when I set out to it initially, all I was doing was taking work I was already doing and putting it out there on the internet. So the marginal increase of time was not much. And so I think as you're evaluating anyone listening to this, evaluate something where you're spending time packaging work you're already doing in a way that there's no downside, Exponential upside and you could stick with it sustainably. Yeah. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>One of the tricky things I find when trying to build a YouTube channel on the side of a day job is if that YouTube channel requires a lot of extra research, it's never going to happen.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The key framework in Ship30 is the two year test, where content creators reflect on knowledge from two years ago and share valuable insights with their past self. This framework involves looking back at skills, hobbies, transitions, jobs, and distilling the knowledge acquired, or looking forward two years to package current learnings for sharing. By documenting the journey of learning and teaching what is learned, individuals can continuously progress in an infinite game, gaining insights, connections, and building valuable things.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>This is one of the key frameworks in Ship30. We call it the two year test. And so it's what should you create content around? You should look backwards two years and reflect on skills you built hobbies you've picked up, life transitions you've made, jobs you quit, job you started, all of this knowledge that's Now extremely obvious to you, but would be incredibly valuable to yourself two years before. All of that is sitting in your head now. You just need to go and share it and distill it and crystallize it. Or you can look forward two years. So your first two years or your first YouTube videos or study videos, correct? You would already learn and done that for two years before that. All you did was spend a little bit of extra time packaging them up and sharing it. Or you can take the reverse and say, I want to look for two years. What are all the things I want to go learn and then make your creation and all the ideas you share documenting that process of going and learning that thing? So there's really two paths. And I think that infinite game and we're playing this right now, it's moving ahead, documenting the journey to the people behind you, and then learning something ahead of you, documenting Yourself, learning that, teaching it to people behind you. And that is the infinite I can continue to progress and play this forever while getting all the upside of learning, meeting people, building valuable things. And that's been my driving framework, where for two years, all I talked about was how to write on the internet. All I did, I wrote hundreds of threads built hundreds of thousands of Twitter followers, just talking about one thing. How do you write? Well, I studied all the people in front of me, distilled all those frameworks. And now I'm at a point where what's next really well, I'm trying to get the business to this point.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The key framework in Ship30, the Two Year Test, advises creating content around knowledge and experiences acquired two years prior to the present moment. Alternatively, you can also look ahead two years and share insights you will have gained by then. This framework presents two paths: sharing past learnings or documenting the process of acquiring new knowledge for the future.

### ‚ú® Summary
The concept of 'before enlightenment, chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water' highlights a continuous cycle of learning, creating, and sharing knowledge. The process involves identifying what one already knows, learning new things, sharing that knowledge, and repeating the cycle endlessly. This approach is described as the 'infinite game,' applicable to every person on earth. It emphasizes the simplicity and universality of sharing unique knowledge and continuously learning.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So in Zen Buddhism or something, there's a phrase of like before enlightenment and after enlightenment. Before enlightenment, it's like a chop wood, carry water, after enlightenment, chop wood, carry water. And I was thinking what I was like, I really like that idea. So like for the last three years working on this book, I've had in my mind of like, once the book is released, then, but not the book's done. And we're just waiting for the publication date. And so thinking of my mind, it's like before the book and after the book, as like before enlightenment, after enlightenment, before the book, learn stuff, make videos after the book, Learn stuff, make videos. Nice. That's the infinite game. Exactly. Make videos. Right. I book every now and then.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That's the method. It's a dream life. And it's something that every single person on earth can do. Yeah. Every single person listening to this, watching this can say, what do I uniquely already know? Talk about that. What do I really want to know? Go learn that and then talk about it. And then just do that for the rest of your life.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>There's a lot of people that have an amazing belief of like, Oh, but like, I don't know, like, why would I normally hear from me? Like, do you get that sort of question a lot with your students?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes. And it's first, you're underestimating the scale of the internet, where you don't need that many people listening to you and being interested in what you're doing.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
To scale a product, it is crucial to gather live feedback and iterate based on it. By addressing issues that hinder success and enhancing what is well-received, a product can evolve and attract users. One-on-one interviews and continuous refinement of the curriculum based on feedback led to the success of Ship30, enabling the company to reach almost 20 cohorts with a stable curriculum. It took ten cohorts of diligent work to solidify the product, demonstrating the value of close interaction with users in the development process.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And you want to iterate your product as with as much live feedback as you can, because the only way you can get a product to scale is if all their friends tell people about it. Every person who takes it tells everyone of their friends. And that's what happens with Ship30. Someone joins. It transforms their life. They become consistent in multiple areas. They start to write. We have people who have wanted to write for 40 years, never got around to it, and then finally hit publish on something and go, Oh my God, I got to go tell everyone of my other potential writer Friends to go take this. The only way we did that was by honing in on something and eliminating all of the problems that kept people from having success and doubling down on the things that people liked the most. And the only way to do that is through those one-on-one interviews where you really get to sit right in front of the person and go, tell me about this. Why why did you join? What made you want to quit? And then we iterated the curriculum and we did that for the first six or seven cohorts. And that was all the work in the beginning that didn't scale that allowed us to now be at almost 20 cohorts where the curriculum hasn't changed in about a year and a half because we've handled All those problems. It took us 10 cohorts to do it. But once you have that done, you know that the problems are going to change and you kind of have that product set in stone. Yeah, nice.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I'm reading a book at the moment called Notes from a Fellow Traveler by Darren Brown, who's a big sort of magician guy here in the UK and a little bit in the US.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
In a system where all equipment is working well except for one that's significantly slower, improving other parts won't increase output. The slow machine acts as a bottleneck. This concept is illustrated by a story of a chubby kid on a hike who slows down the group, representing the bottleneck. By addressing the slow kid's issues, such as lightening his load and providing assistance, the system's overall efficiency improves. The key takeaway is that focusing on the bottleneck, or the limiting factor, is crucial for overall system optimization.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>If every piece of equipment is humming, but there's one with a giant backlog that moves way slower than everything else, if you improve every other part of the system, it's still not Going to have more output because that one machine is holding everyone else back. And so he has a great, he's got a great example of this. He's walking with like a group of cub scouts going through their on a hike. And there's this chubby kid, I can't remember his name, but it's like Hurley or something like that. And he is trying to keep everyone together and Hurley is sitting in the back and he's like sweating and he can't keep up with everyone. And so all the kids are dispersed and he can't keep track of all of them on this hike because he's trying to keep them all in a line. But like one keeps falling back and then they fall back with them. So the bottleneck of the whole system is the chubby kid who's moving the slowest. So he moves him to the front of the line and makes everyone else fall behind him. So now you see everyone is not allowed to pass Hurley and he's the bottleneck. And then they say, how do we fix that? Well, we should probably take his big backpack off and move it to everyone else behind so he can walk a little bit faster. So they do that. And then they get a little like trike and put Hurley on it. And then he's moving even faster and everyone else can continue to keep up. And so it's this idea that unless you're working on the thing that's limiting everything else, you're wasting your time.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The story illustrates the importance of identifying and addressing bottlenecks to enhance efficiency. By focusing on the slowest-moving component, in this case, the chubby kid, and adjusting the strategy to optimize their performance, the group was able to improve the overall speed and efficiency of the hike. This concept is applicable in business as well, where bottlenecks can occur in lead generation, conversion rate, or operational processes. By identifying these bottlenecks and setting clear goals, businesses can prioritize their efforts effectively and improve overall performance.

### ‚ú® Summary
The key to improving a business lies in identifying and addressing bottlenecks that hinder its progress. By focusing on the bottleneck that is limiting everything else, such as getting more leads, improving lead conversion, or optimizing operations, one can maximize business performance. This process starts with setting a clear goal, identifying the bottleneck, and making iterative improvements to overcome it.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But like one keeps falling back and then they fall back with them. So the bottleneck of the whole system is the chubby kid who's moving the slowest. So he moves him to the front of the line and makes everyone else fall behind him. So now you see everyone is not allowed to pass Hurley and he's the bottleneck. And then they say, how do we fix that? Well, we should probably take his big backpack off and move it to everyone else behind so he can walk a little bit faster. So they do that. And then they get a little like trike and put Hurley on it. And then he's moving even faster and everyone else can continue to keep up. And so it's this idea that unless you're working on the thing that's limiting everything else, you're wasting your time.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So that requires you to have a goal, right? Because otherwise, how would you know what the bottleneck is?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It always starts with a goal. Okay. Yes. And then you so we call this identify, inhale and iterate. First, you need to identify the goal and the bottleneck to achieve in that goal. So let's just paint a like for my business, for example, like, correct.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Let's do it. Yeah, sure.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So and this is where it gets a lot of fun. The bottleneck is going to be in one of three places. Any way to improve a business, it's you can get more leads, better conversion of those leads, or tighter operations to fulfill the product or service. Okay, nice. So your bottleneck is going to lie in one of those three things.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The strategy involves identifying the goal and bottleneck, which could be related to getting more leads, improving lead conversion, or enhancing operational efficiency. Once identified, resources need to be inhaled to address the bottleneck, such as running paid ads or improving product quality. This strategy is applicable not only in business but also in personal life to overcome obstacles and achieve goals effectively.

### ‚ú® Summary
The key to improving a business lies in three main areas: generating more leads, increasing conversion rates, and streamlining operations. If a business is not attracting enough customers, the focus should be on getting more leads or enhancing conversion rates. If the product is not well-received, the priority should be improving the product rather than gaining more leads. This principle applies not only to business but also to personal goals. Identifying bottlenecks is crucial, followed by taking steps to eliminate them by utilizing various resources efficiently.

### ‚ú® Summary
Efficiency in video creation was enhanced by recognizing bottlenecks early on, such as scripting videos word for word, lack of proper equipment like a tripod, and time-consuming setup. Solutions included using bullet points instead of scripts, investing in proper equipment like a tripod, leaving cameras and lights set up at all times, building systems for generating ideas, and eventually leveraging people to improve efficiency.

Like if I think back, I recognize very early on in the in the whole YouTube journey while I was doing it full time while I was working as a doctor as well, was like, Oh, the bottleneck is it Takes too long to film a video. How do we fix that bottleneck? I mean, I didn't use the language of bottleneck. It was like, where's the friction point? I was thinking like, what's the highest? Like, why is it so high friction to film a video? It's because I was trying to script it word for word. What if I just don't do that? What if I go to bullet points? Boom, twice as fast. Okay, what else is annoying? It takes, at the start, I was, I didn't want to buy a tripod. So I was like, stacking up medical textbooks and putting the camera on it because I was like, who needs a 30 dollar tripod? I was like, let's just buy the tripod. Next, it takes an hour to set up the cameras and lights and shit. Why don't I just leave it up at all times? Good. As I get all of the points of like reducing the friction for me filming videos. And then at some point it was like, I don't have enough ideas through the system. Okay, cool. How do I build a system for it that I can do it myself? Because systems create leverage. And then two years down the line, I thought, I thought of hiring someone. I was like, Oh shit, people are at leverage as well. And so at each point, it's like that thing.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
To reach business success, identify and address bottlenecks continuously. Establish a framework by focusing on specificity: a specific platform, person, problem, and way of doing things. Concentrate on excelling in one platform, solving a specific problem that people will pay for, and targeting a specific audience. By narrowing down your focus and leveraging specificity, you can efficiently work towards achieving your business goals.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And the bottlenecks always going to change. And your new bottleneck might be, how do I sustainably do this forever? And you have to go solve that problem. So the bottlenecks always going to change. Now, just to get tactical on the business side of how do I actually come up with a framework for getting to a million dollars in a year, I think laying that out will be helpful because you Can apply bottleneck thinking only to a system that you know is going to get you to where you want to go. So let me explain. I think there are a good chunk of this from Alex from Ozzy, some other internet marketing just in general to get to a million dollars a year and something. It's four layers of specificity. So a specific platform, a specific person, a specific problem in a specific way for things. And I'm going to use ship 30 as the example for this. So specific platform is you need to market your product on one channel, one platform. That could be Facebook ads, could be Instagram ads, could be Twitter organic, it could be LinkedIn, it could be threads, it could be YouTube, one product, one platform. That's it. Until you get to a million dollars in a year and people go, but I need to be a no one. Why? Because you concentrate all of that attention on getting good at that one platform that allows you to market the thing. So platform, pick a platform, whatever you like to do. If you like to make videos, make YouTube videos. If you like to write, pick Twitter. If you like, you know, LinkedIn, whatever, specific platform, check, got it. All right, specific person. I actually think you should start with problem and then go to person. So let's go problem. Ship 30 was, so you need to pick a specific problem to solve and people will exchange money for that problem. I'm going to paint the full picture of ship 30. We marketed on Twitter. That was a platform. The person was beginner writers who wanted to start writing on the internet.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
When starting a project, decide on a specific problem to solve and the target audience before selecting the platform. By addressing a particular issue and catering to the needs of a specific group of people, success can be achieved. For example, Ship 30 targeted beginner writers on Twitter offering them a solution to start writing online by committing to writing daily for 30 days, generating over a million dollars in revenue. Similarly, PT YA aimed to assist aspiring YouTubers in creating channels through a structured six-week course, initially marketed on Twitter and later on YouTube.

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker discusses their approach of launching a six-week course first on Twitter before expanding to other platforms like YouTube and Instagram. They emphasize the importance of addressing bottlenecks, such as not knowing the specific target audience or the right platform by launching the product first and then narrowing down based on success. The strategy involves continuously experimenting and adapting based on results to eventually reach a revenue goal of 10 million a year, which is reframed as 12 million for clarity.

Exactly.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So it was Twitter first and I was like, cool. That's fine. Then you go there and now you can talk about it on YouTube or Instagram or LinkedIn or other places. Right. Yeah. So when you have this framework, you can go, all right, how can I apply the bottleneck thinking to that? Well, the bottleneck is, I don't know the specific person. So I need to launch the product and then figure out who had the most success and then niche it down to only talk to that person. Or it's, I don't know the platform. Well, you should just pick one and figure out which one you like and run an experiment. So, interesting.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That's the full framework. That's good. Neither of us are yet at 10 million a year. Like, do you have a sense of what it would take together?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes. So to get to 10 million a year, I like to call it 12 million because that's a million a month.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, why not?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
To achieve a million a month revenue, reverse engineer the target by considering pricing, services, and products offered. Instead of fixating on reaching a 10k month, focus on strategies like selling one high-ticket item or multiple lower-priced items to achieve the revenue goal. It is essential to break down the target into manageable daily goals and experiment with different platforms to identify the most effective marketing strategy.

Then you go there and now you can talk about it on YouTube or Instagram or LinkedIn or other places. Right. Yeah. So when you have this framework, you can go, all right, how can I apply the bottleneck thinking to that? Well, the bottleneck is, I don't know the specific person. So I need to launch the product and then figure out who had the most success and then niche it down to only talk to that person. Or it's, I don't know the platform. Well, you should just pick one and figure out which one you like and run an experiment. So, interesting.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That's the full framework. That's good. Neither of us are yet at 10 million a year. Like, do you have a sense of what it would take together?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes. So to get to 10 million a year, I like to call it 12 million because that's a million a month.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, why not?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So a million a month, you need to reverse engineer what a million dollars in a month looks like. Well, I need to figure out all the different pricing and services and products that I offer and do the math. Most people picture like, how do I get the 10k month? It's like, well, you could sell one person a $10,000 service. You could sell 100 people a $100 service or product or something like that. Like, what does that look like on a daily basis?</blockquote>

### [01:14:31] Reverse Engineering Million Dollar Revenue

### ‚ú® Summary
To achieve a million dollars in monthly revenue, reverse engineer by understanding product pricing and offerings. Break down the target into daily sales requirements, such as selling six products worth $500 each per day. Identify the necessary steps like website visits and email reads to reach the sales goal. Consider launching higher value and more scalable products to reach revenue targets efficiently. Start with smaller revenue goals like $1,000 or $100 to identify bottlenecks. The key is to know the answer, which often involves providing higher value services to existing customers.

Well, I need to figure out all the different pricing and services and products that I offer and do the math. Most people picture like, how do I get the 10k month? It's like, well, you could sell one person a $10,000 service. You could sell 100 people a $100 service or product or something like that. Like, what does that look like on a daily basis? Well, okay, to make a million dollars in a month, let's say the only product I sell is worth $500, I need to sell 200 of them. That means I need to sell six a day. What do I need to sell six a day? I need this many people to see the landing page. I need this many people to read the emails. Like, the path is extremely there. We just have to put the full equation out. And right now, for us to get there, it's unlikely that we'd be able to fulfill the products and services that we currently offer to get to a million a month because of the amount of labor That would go into it. So instead, you have to think, okay, how could I launch a more valuable product or a more scalable version? So you just kind of sit there and say, how do I get to this number? And what I don't want to do is people listen to this and go, all right, million a month. Now I need to go think about that. It's like, no, start with $1,000 or $100 or do the bottleneck analysis that way because you have to get into here to do it. But that's the whole game right now is figuring out, okay, what is that bottleneck? And if I had the answer, the frustrating part is most of the time, I know what the answer is. I'm just not doing it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Do you know what the answer is for you guys?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>It's launching a higher value service on the back of our ghost writing coaching program. Okay, because when you do that, you double the customer on TV. Then we know exactly we don't have to do anything new. We just provide more value to the people already servicing. And then we'll get there. Okay, interesting.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That's a good shit, man. That's a good stuff.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That's a good shit, man. That's a good stuff. Yeah, at some point, like, I was talking to the team about this yesterday. At some point, the business becomes less about doing creative things and more about just doing the maths. Like even now, we have these products. We're doing a few million a year. But like, if anyone sat me, if I was speaking to Brendan Bouchard or someone who just makes more money than we do, like 10x, he'd be like, what are your funnels and what are your percentage Conversions? I'd be like, I have no clue. Yeah, I just have a little Google Analytics.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Who knows? Well, it's obvious. It's like, we've kind of made the whole thing up. And that's the thing. Like, I hope that makes other people who hear this. Like, we do not have it all figured out. Certainly. Like, you kind of just go day by day and make it all up as you go. And then you kind of end up in a place of like, okay, maybe we should look backwards and clean up some of this mess. Yes. And the way we think about this is like three months, you can get to a new level. And then you really spend six months getting comfortable at that level and fixing everything that just broke to get to that new. So when you every time the business triples, all your infrastructure is going to break. And that has happened to us every single new level. Yeah. Right. So you can get to a new level with like three months of intense effort.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
In business, progress is made by constantly evolving and adapting to new levels, with each new level requiring intense effort for three months, followed by six months to stabilize and fix what broke during the transition. Seeking guidance from a coach or mentor who has experienced similar growth can save valuable time, as it is a common path that many successful businesses have navigated. Acknowledging that others have achieved similar success and leveraging their expertise can help in streamlining growth and reaching a wider audience.

And I still undervalue the value of that because I'm always like, oh, my God, our business is unique. And it's like, it's really not like people are making been making tens of millions doing content equals info product or ads equals info product businesses for decades. It's not that hard.

### [01:17:57] Invest in Growth to Unlock the Next Level

### ‚ú® Summary
To advance in business, one must be willing to invest financially in opportunities that promise substantial returns, such as coaching programs or mastermind groups. Investing money in learning and growth is crucial for business development and can lead to immediate returns. Time is valuable, and choosing to invest money rather than time in acquiring knowledge and expertise is key to progressing and avoiding regrets.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yes. And so why don't I just do it? And to be honest, it goes back to personal money beliefs. Because if someone came to you and was like, Hey, I'm going to charge you a hundred thousand dollars for one day of coaching. But it's going to remove the bottleneck to help you guys make 200,000 tomorrow. It would still be extremely uncomfortable to put that hundred thousand out there. But at a certain point, the only way you get to the next level in business is by spending that. So I saw like Alex from Mosey paid Grant Cardone $200,000 for an hour of consulting just to hear about the way he thinks about like branding and whatever. And that was to everyone else would not be a high financial return. But the only way to unlock that next level is to pay that amount because of the return you're going to get on it. Right. So in the beginning, it might be a $19 product that you need to go buy. And that's the only thing you need to buy to get to the next level. But then you probably need to buy more specific $5,000 coaching program or we joined a $68,000 mastermind. Why? Because it was the only way we were going to get the information that we needed to go and put a new product into practice. And we saw the return on it immediately. But that was the only way we were going to get that information.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Was it actually the only way? Like could you like in hindsight, I've found that information for free somewhere on the internet.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>But you're going to pay with your time and your time is far more valuable. And that's the second belief that you have to understand is you're either going to pay for anything in two ways. You can buy it or you can pay with your time. And if I've learned anything over the last three years, it's I regret every moment that I paid with my time rather than investing my money.</blockquote>

### [01:20:44] Value Over Time

### ‚ú® Summary
The value of investing in expensive courses or masterminds increases for those who are advanced in the field and can save time by paying for information instead of spending hours searching for it. In the information product world, people pay for packaging, speed, implementation, and outcomes, not for the information itself. Providing information for free is common, but what people pay for is the guidance, accountability, templates, and support to put that information into action. The more value a product or service provides, the more people are willing to pay for it.


#### üìö Transcript

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Because the value of the time it is saving you increases. So a beginner paying for a 50k Mastermind is a negative return because their time is not worth it. They should spend 100 hours watching YouTube videos for free because they're 100 hours. But someone who's way further in the game who can pay with money instead of time to inhale that information. And that's the whole thing about the information product world as you're not selling information because people don't pay for information. All that is free. People pay for packaging, speed, implementation and outcomes.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Packaging speed, implementation and outcomes. Okay.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Right. So if you are trying to sell information, don't sell information. Give that all the way for free because people are going to learn it. And most people don't do anything with information when they learn it. They need it packaged up and given a step-by-step guide. And so if you go and read through my Twitter for a couple of years, you'll find probably the whole ship 30 curriculum. We give away most of it in our free ultimate guide. But what you don't get is the accountability, the check-ins, the templates, all the things that are actually going to get you to put that information in practice. And that's what people pay for. The amount you pay for, it just goes up because the amount of value it's providing goes up.</blockquote>

### [01:24:13] Identifying and Addressing Health and Fitness Bottlenecks

### ‚ú® Summary
In health and fitness goals, identifying the bottleneck involves understanding the core obstacle hindering progress. Using the example of weight loss, the speaker aimed to shed 100 pounds, starting at 280 pounds. The bottleneck was the lack of knowledge on how to lose weight effectively. By delving deeper into root causes, such as overeating and inadequate satiating foods, the speaker identified the need for an appropriate diet plan to maintain satiety while consuming fewer calories than burnt. By addressing this bottleneck and finding a sustainable eating plan, the speaker could successfully achieve his weight loss goals.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>You mentioned you applied the bottleneck thing to health fitness relationships.

I played football in college. I was an offensive lineman. I needed to lose weight. So what was the goal? I needed to lose 100 pounds to get to, I'm like 190 now. So about 100. What's the bottleneck? Well, if I need to lose weight, first I need to know how to do that. So I didn't know how to do that. So I inhaled information to go and do it. And it's like, hey, eat less than you burn. Simple, easy. There's the answer. Now, why are I doing that? Well, I like these kinds of foods, and I'm eating too much of them. Why am I doing that? Well, I didn't learn how to eat something that is more satiating. Why didn't I learn that? So you just keep doing this like why all neck analysis until I realize, well, first I need to find a diet that allows me to not be hungry all the time and eat less than I burn.</blockquote>

### [01:25:04] Identifying and Addressing Ignorance as the First Bottleneck to Achieving Goals

### ‚ú® Summary
The key insight from the snip is that when setting a goal, the first bottleneck to address is typically ignorance. The speaker explains that not knowing the necessary steps to achieve your goal often hinders progress. By identifying this ignorance and seeking information to overcome it, individuals can then establish a clear plan of action. This process may involve understanding why current habits are hindering progress, learning about more effective strategies, and iteratively trying different approaches until finding what works best. Whether the goal is weight loss or muscle gain, addressing ignorance and seeking knowledge are fundamental steps towards successful goal achievement.

Well, I didn't learn how to eat something that is more satiating. Why didn't I learn that? So you just keep doing this like why all neck analysis until I realize, well, first I need to find a diet that allows me to not be hungry all the time and eat less than I burn. Pretty simple solution. What does that look like? I had to go iterate and try a bunch of different ones. I tried every single thing out there. Keto, carnival, high carb, low carb, vegan, everything. Until I found I lost like 75 pounds on the ketogenic diet. Why? Because I could eat steak and eggs and feel very full and still eat fewer calories than I burn. Very simple. So that was how I applied it to that. If you apply it to lifting weights in the gym, it's like, I want to put muscle on. How do I do that? Well, I need to do a certain first I need to find out how. So almost always, the first bottleneck is an ignorance tax. You don't know what to do. And okay, so I do a framework for overall improvement. You're either don't know what to do. You are not doing what you need to do.</blockquote>

In personal improvement, the key lies in knowing what to do and then understanding why you are not doing it. If you don't know what to do, figure it out first. Then, analyze why you are not acting. The crucial factors for personal development are identifying the right actions and addressing the reasons behind inaction.

So we talked about it for business, it's more conversion, or more leads better conversion, tighter operations. For personal improvement, it's what to do. Why are you doing it?

### ‚ú® Summary
Setting goals requires having a clear direction of where you want to go and an honest assessment of where you currently are. Without knowing the end goal and accepting the reality of your current situation, you cannot progress. Start by determining your destination, evaluating your current position, and identifying the next step in the right direction. Utilize bottleneck thinking to pinpoint the necessary actions to move forward.

I think you just need some kind of direction. Where you know, all right, I'm just going to point that way. I know where the end goal is. And then I'm going to get to where I am to get anywhere you know, at least a rough idea of where you want to go. And you need inconvenient harsh truth clarity of where you are currently. And if you can't accept that first one, or if you don't know where you're going, you're not going to be able to point yourself in the right direction. And if you can't confront the inconvenient truth of where you currently are, you're not going to make the improvements to get to the next step. So I always start with where do I want to go? Where am I? And then what's at least the next step that I know is in the right direction? And then I apply that bottleneck thinking of, okay, I need to go learn this. I need to go talk to this person and to go pay for this program. I need to whatever.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Rejection is just a test to see how much you want something; every rejection indicates a desire to achieve. The fear of asking holds many back from success in business and life. Progress is closer than most think; starting is key. To get what you want, you must ask for it. The gap between where you are and where you want to be is smaller than perceived. Embracing entrepreneurship may be a bold move, but it's a path worth considering.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>By the way, in case you haven't heard, my brand new book, Feel Good Productivity is now out. It is available everywhere books are sold, and it's actually hit the New York Times and also the Sunday Times bestseller list. So thank you to everyone who's already got a copy of the book. If you read the book already, I would love a review on Amazon, and if you haven't yet checked it out, you may like to check it out. It's available in physical format and also e-book and also audio book everywhere books are sold. Every rejection is just a test if you want something. Ooh, every rejection is just a test if you want something.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>100%. And so when she rejected me, I was like, yeah, I want this book. There's nothing else out there like it that helps you overcome your fear and helps you get the business actually started and then growing. I wrote a blog post for Tim Ferris's site in 2011. Damn, old school. It's super old school and it was like, how to start a million dollar business in a weekend. And it went super viral. I've seen that literally so many people hold them back from success in business and in life is the fear of asking. If you don't start, you'll never get anywhere. And if you don't ask, you'll never get what you want. No ask, no get. Bloody hell. That's good shit. Where most people are and where they can be is actually closer than they think. Where they are and where they actually want to be is closer than they think. Who they are and who they think they could be is closer than they think.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>But they have to start.

### ‚ú® Summary
The key insight is that many aspiring entrepreneurs are held back by two significant fears: the fear of starting and emotional barriers. A crucial aspect is addressing the emotional hurdles before delving into the business components like checking the market size and creating a business model. By first overcoming the emotional obstacles, starting a business becomes easier, leading to higher chances of success.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>What would I have to do? I have to follow him like we're now. Exactly. I mean, I think what's interesting is that there's so many, so so much content about how to sort of business. Yeah. TikTok, social media, blogs, books, like if there's so much out there, how can people have not done it that want to do it? That's the question. And so 15 years ago, I had a dream to write this book. I was with my buddy, Adam Giller from my body tutor and we were biking New York and I was like, there's just no book out there that if I wanted to get started without taking funding, without Spending a lot of time, without spending any money, there's nothing out there. And so I wanted to be able to put that together and solve the actual hard problem, which is why aren't people being successful? Yeah. And there's basically just two fears why most of the audiences that want to start a business, which I think everyone should be an entrepreneur, have not done it yet. And then the business part is the other half of the book, which is like, how do you value your idea? How do you check the market size? How do you check your one-minute business model?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>That part I find a lot easier is just the fears that are holding people back from their success. Ooh. Okay. This is interesting because I also encountered this problem a lot when I speak to people who want to start a YouTube channel, want to start a business. And I'm often surprised by how much of the conversation is like therapy slash emotional support rather than like, okay, let's figure out the target market and the competitive analysis And all that stuff. Yeah. What are the fears? You said there were two big fears? Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And so in terms of the business, and we can definitely dive into like checking your business model, checking the market size, finding your first customers, and then how do you scale That stuff to like, let's start with the emotional.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Yeah, we'll come back to that.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We'll come back to the, the, the, the, the stuff is, and this stuff, no one recognizes how, how afraid they actually are of this.

Once you overcome them and there's fun ways to actually overcome it and a lot of people in the book have done it, then all the other business is easy. So the first one is the fear of starting.

### ‚ú® Summary
Two major fears that hinder success in business and life are the fear of starting and the fear of asking. The fear of starting revolves around the belief that one needs more resources or knowledge to begin, when in reality, the right time to start is now. Confidence comes through action. The fear of asking limits progress as well, as not asking equates to not receiving. Asking is a skill that can be practiced, leading to opportunities and successes in both business and life.

### ‚ú® Summary
Success in business comes from getting comfortable with asking and facing rejection positively. Shifting the perspective towards asking as a beneficial action can open doors to various opportunities. Practicing asking through small challenges like the coffee challenge creates resilience and strength to handle rejection. Overcoming the fear of rejection and failure is essential for personal and professional growth.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That's why people have not had success in business yet. Because they can't get comfortable asking, getting rejected, realizing it's okay. Maybe it was the offer. Maybe it's not the right person. And then moving forward to find someone you can't help. And most of the time, it's actually switching the context. So what you're thinking is it's a bad thing to ask. But what if you ask for a sponsor for your show from Notion and you help them promote? You're just asking them for something. That's actually a good thing for them. And the more that you can actually switch them mentality, you're like, Oh, shit, I can start asking for a lot of different things. Maybe a raise, maybe a customer, maybe an ask a girlfriend. You know, there's all these other things you can start asking for. And the reason I love the coffee challenge is that it's a safe way to practice asking. They say no to you when you ask for it. So when you go to a coffee place or anywhere you go next time, I did it at the hotel room about an hour ago, got to the hotel friend desk and said, Can I have an upgrade please for free? And he looks at me like, What are you doing? I was like, Yeah, he's like, No, it costs money. It's like, Okay, thanks. Right. It's like, I'm still doing it to this day. Yeah. And it's doing it in the small ways you do it in business. But when you go and ask for the discount, it's just recognizing that once they say, No, life goes forward and you can learn and get better and you get stronger.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Will you come into doing it? Mate, I'm feeling the shaking. I'm like tearing up. People just think like hearing you hear you hearing you say this. Yeah. What you're saying is like touching a pot of me that has this like primal fear of like rejection, I think. Yeah. Fear of rejection, fear of failure, all of those things.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>We're all afraid of it. It doesn't go away. I'm still afraid. And if you look at my videos, it's like asking private jets, knocking on people's doors, doing it on the streets.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Facing the primal fear of rejection is a common struggle for everyone. By reframing it as a game with rejection goals, the fear can be managed effectively. Setting small goals like getting rejected a certain number of times or talking to a few people helps in desensitizing and normalizing rejection. This approach not only reduces anxiety but also increases the chances of unexpected positive outcomes like getting a yes or finding potential customers.

But I'm like, all right, I'm going to go and get rejected 10 times on the street. Yeah. Or I'm going to try to go and talk to like two people and then you do it. And it's like, okay, I hit my goal. It's fine. And guess what? Throughout that, you might actually get a yes. Throughout that, you might get a discount. Throughout that, you might get a customer.

### ‚ú® Summary
One approach to overcoming fear of rejection is to set rejection goals, turning it into a game to desensitize oneself. By practicing rejection and setting achievable goals, one can lessen the fear and potentially yield positive outcomes. Additionally, reframing selling as helping can shift the perspective from a negative to a positive interaction. Viewing sales as assisting others and focusing on the concept of listen, options, and transition can make the process smoother and more beneficial for both parties involved.

So it sounds like if I hear you right, you want to work on consistency and you want to be able to make $3,000 a month.

### ‚ú® Summary
The key to successful sales lies in understanding the customer's pain points, determining the value of a solution to them, and offering options that address their needs. By listening to the customer's problems and assessing their worth, a salesperson can present a tailored solution that resonates with the customer.

So it's more, how are you trying to understand the person to be able to transition them to success for themselves? Yeah. And a lot of times not selling is powerful.

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker discusses how individuals can learn about themselves and earn extra income by starting side businesses like baking, selling, or starting a YouTube channel.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>So it sounds like you're saying that like, even if someone has a day job, then they can learn a lot about themselves and they can get some extra pocket money by doing something on the side, Whether it's baking cookies, selling strawberries, selling wine, or starting a YouTube channel, doing web development. And eventually the people who get going are the ones who then have the option of taking it forward if they want.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Have you ever been fired?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Have I ever been fired? No, I've never been fired. What's it like? That was good.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>That was good. That was good. That was good. That was good.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You realize that everyone is replaceable and you don't have as much control in your life as you think. And especially today where interest rates are high, there might be coming down, mortgage rates over the place, companies are back. They are cutting back. I think now more than ever people need to figure out for themselves how to at least have that option available to them. Whether you work at AppSumo, we have a lot of people with their own business at AppSumo. We encourage it. But another company is like, if you have a day job that you like, they could still get rid of you at any moment. Any moment. Yeah. There's no obligation to them. And so having your own option that you've created that you have, one, it's fun. At least gives you that option so that if things don't go your way, you're in control of something. Nice.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Mate, I love this. I'm fully on board with what you're saying. I think in the past, I've been hesitant to say everyone should become an entrepreneur because I've always got the thing of like, well, what if I enjoy my job and all this kind of stuff? And I've always said that like, well, okay, but wouldn't it be nice? Lots of people in the pandemic lost their jobs.</blockquote>

Having your own business provides you control and the option to pivot if necessary, especially with the unpredictability of job security in today's economy. Being reliant on a single employer for income leaves you vulnerable to sudden changes or job loss, reinforcing the importance of creating entrepreneurial opportunities and learning new skills to secure your financial stability. Additionally, pursuing entrepreneurship allows for personal growth and self-discovery, presenting a fulfilling and engaging journey towards financial independence.

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker emphasizes the importance of consistency and persistence in pursuing dreams. They introduce the concept of the 'Law of 100', which involves committing to a task for 100 days to achieve success. By sharing their personal experience with podcasts and YouTube, the speaker highlights the tendency for people to quit too soon when they don't see immediate large-scale results. The 'Law of 100' serves as a framework for individuals to stay dedicated to their goals by performing small, consistent actions daily, such as making one call a day or one social post a day. This approach enables individuals to overcome challenges and achieve long-term success in their endeavors.

I didn't want to live a what if life.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I wanted to know that I have dreams of how I want to spend my day, which is with his kids. Yeah. And I didn't want to not be able to take that chance now and show and lead by example, showing the kids how he is so that he has an opportunity one day in the future. But you'll never get there unless you start. Yeah. And then sticking with it, which is law of 100, which is like doing these things and sticking with these things. What do you mean? What's law of 100? So you've started YouTube. You've started a business. Most people quit too soon.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>You see it all the time. I see it all the time. We start these things and we make a little bit of money. Yeah. How do I stick with it? So law of 100 is how do you apply to 100 days or 100 videos or 100 emails or 100 calls? Whatever it is. For me, it was podcasts. I quit too soon. And I was basically getting tons of downloads per episode. But because it wasn't, it was 30,000 downloads and it wasn't 100,000 downloads. I quit at around 40 podcasts. If I would have just stayed. And so I've noticed this trend where the people who are my successful started and they need some framework to stick with it. So for me, it was this law of 100 to actually be able to stick with YouTube now three years and then continuing. I'm now on a 10 year plan for YouTube. And so just finding that people need a framework to be able to as they start something now. Okay. Let's call it one customer day. Don't make it a big thing. Just first, if you have a day job and you got kids and you got a family, that's a lot going on. One call a day, one social post a day, one email a day, whatever it is, just pick 100 of them and then stick with it.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So my taking a step back, I do believe a lot of people when they're born in a certain class economically, and this is what I believe are believing that they have to stay there. I grew up in a class so I stay in a class. That's how I felt. I felt my parents had normal jobs. My dad was an engineer. My mom was a nurse. And I was like, I guess that's just where you stay. And realizing there's all these levels to life and realizing you can do any kind of life you want. There's no, there's no rule to how you live. It's how you ever want to. I remember as I'm dating this Venezuelan woman and she's in Spain and I kept thinking, I don't know, but that's not part of the normal plan. I had this buddy, Tynan, who I love Tynan. He's like, you make the rule. You create it. And money, which is available to everyone, sometimes it's harder depending on how you were born and how you were certain situations, but it's available. And you can create it. And I just lived so middle class and poor basically until COVID. I was a multi multi multi-millionaire. And then when COVID happened, I was just realizing that, holy shit, like I have all this money and I've worked so hard to get it. I'm just not enjoying it. And I started testing it. So one of the things about being an entrepreneur is that we make it so scary. We're like, oh, it's oh my God, it's this big ass thing. You have to quit your J-dope. Don't quit your J-dope. That's risky. Having a day job you hate, that's also risky. But start testing things out. And so I started experimenting and enjoying money. I started experimenting.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And then when COVID happened, I was just realizing that, holy shit, like I have all this money and I've worked so hard to get it. I'm just not enjoying it. And I started testing it. So one of the things about being an entrepreneur is that we make it so scary. We're like, oh, it's oh my God, it's this big ass thing. You have to quit your J-dope. Don't quit your J-dope. That's risky. Having a day job you hate, that's also risky. But start testing things out. And so I started experimenting and enjoying money. I started experimenting. Like, can I buy happiness with money? Because I was told that you can't. Like, that's what they say. And I was like, let me question this thing. And I started renting, like, I rented a Malibu beach house for 25k. And I was like, oh, yeah, money can definitely buy happiness. Then I rented another house in Austin on the lake. That was 7,000. Everything was cheaper, by the way, during COVID. And, you know, if you want a million dollar experiences, I rented a Lambo here in LA a few years ago during that experience for $250 in a turo. Oh, it was great. It's not bad. And I was like, I don't give two shits to have a Lambo. Yeah. You tested it out and realized you didn't want it. Yeah, I experimented. And I think if you can think of how do I have an experiment or mindset in these different areas of life, huh, maybe I can experiment being rich. See if I actually like being rich. Maybe I can experiment having a six pack, which everyone has. And see if you actually want it, I've had a six pack. I'm like, it sucks. I like drinking and eating. I don't want to live that life. And actually enjoying the money now, I'm like, this is so great not worrying about which groceries I have to buy. Going to a store.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker conducts mini experiments in life to test if spending more money on something actually enhances happiness or if contentment can be achieved without it. They discuss the importance of enjoying both creating money and enjoying it, which is often overlooked. It is highlighted that failure in an experiment does not mean giving up entirely but learning from it. People are encouraged to reconsider their financial goals, suggesting that one may not necessarily need to be a millionaire but have enough for essentials or small luxuries.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>So it's like running these sort of mini experts.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>These are dumb examples, but these mini experiments in my life to be like, does spending more money on the thing X actually improve my happiness with thing X? Or can I just not do that and still be totally content? Exactly. And I'm getting more and more of this data over time.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Well, and I think this applies not just there's two separate things if we take a step back. There's one about enjoying creating the money. And then the second part that we're talking about is enjoying your money. Yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>And this part no one talks about because most people are still trying to create. Yeah, it's also very unfashionable to talk about how I enjoy money once you're already rich.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>And it's like, yeah.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And what the reality though, and I think what you're commenting on is actually really interesting. This is super powerful. When you do an experiment and it fails, you don't say like, I'm going to give up and blow this whole thing up. What do you do?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 3</b><br/><br/>You're done from it. And you're like, trying to level it.</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Yeah. And so if people start thinking, all right, if I want to start a business, I want to be an entrepreneur. I want to get this great investment. Maybe I don't want to be a millionaire. Maybe I just want enough for groceries. Maybe I want enough for seed upgrades. Or maybe they want to be able to go to a nice meal.</blockquote>

### [12:04] The impact of visual scenes on creativity and ideating


[üéß Play snip - 3minÔ∏è (10:37 - 13:08)](https://share.snipd.com/snip/865a9493-14ea-408d-a8dc-1d2d9e36ab4e)

### ‚ú® Summary
Staring at visual scenes like a fireplace or ocean waves can lead to a non-linear thinking state by detaching from linear thought patterns. The randomness in the visual scenes prompts creativity and ideation by sparking connections and brainstorming. Reading or walking in such environments can aid in original focused ideation and serendipitous idea generation by quieting certain neural circuits and enhancing internal focus on conceptual thinking.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>I'm curious about the fireplace. I have this theory based on my understanding of visual neuroscience and the fact that when we're looking at visual scenes that have some degree of predictability to them, we get into A mode of anticipation, or thinking is at least somewhat linear and so forth. When we are looking at, say, ocean waves or in a skyscraper, we're staring down at the street of, say, New York City and the cars are moving in, obviously not random fashion, but at least To our visual perception, pseudo-random. You're not tracking any one thing. The mind goes into this sort of state where our thoughts become non-linear or they're not anchored to any kind of if-then, what I call DPO, duration path outcome, trajectory. There's not a lot of neuroscience on this, but there's a little bit. Same thing happens when you're looking at an aquarium, by the way. I wonder whether or not staring at the fire, which is something that humans have been doing for many, many, many thousands of years, because it has that random aspect to it. Does it tend to spark creativity, linear thinking?</blockquote><br/><blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>At what point in your writing do you turn to the fire and stare at it? That's interesting. Actually, there's a neurological explanation. When I use the fires actually when I read, so I have chairs by the fire, but I think for exactly this reason. Because when I'm reading, I'm looking to spark ideas. What's my takeaway from this? What's the connection you're making between this thing you're reading here and this idea over there? That type of connection making is a lot of my brainstorming. I read by the fire when the weather allows it. I also walk a lot. I wonder if there's something similar going on. When I'm trying to work through an idea for an article or a math proof or something like this, almost always I'm going to do that on foot. There might be something similar going on there where you're encountering, it's not entirely exotic stimuli. It's not, oh my God, my attention's being drawn, but you don't quite know what you're going to see. You also have that circuit quieting effect of the walking. Your motor neurons are going. You can tell if I'm getting this right or not. The motor neurons are going and you get some inhibition going on in some of these key networks, which allows you to actually maintain the internal focus on a concept a little bit better. I do a lot of my original focused ideating on foot, but a lot of my serendipitous ideating will be with the fire going. It's the way I read by the fire. It's when I read that I get a lot of my original ideas.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
An effective learning recall protocol involves reading material first, then taking a break to recall specific elements without looking at the material. After that, revisiting the material to reinforce memory retrieval results in significantly improved learning outcomes. This protocol taps into the brain's natural learning process, which is often overlooked in traditional learning methods.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 2</b><br/><br/>Tell me what you think of this, what I always call protocol. If I want to learn something from a manuscript I read or a book chapter, I used to highlight things and I had a very elaborate extracted from my university days system of stars and exclamation Marks and underlined that mean a lot to me that can, yes, bring me back to a given segment within the chapter. But a few years ago, I was teaching a course in the biology department at Stanford and for some reason, we had them read a study about information retention. I learned from that study, one of the best things we can do is read information in whatever form, a magazine, research article, etc. A book. Then to take some time away from that material, maybe walk, maybe close one of the eyes, maybe leave them open, doesn't matter. Just try and remember specific elements. How much does one remember? Then go back to the material and look at it. I've just been positively astonished at how much more information I can learn when I'm not simply going through motor commands of just underlining things and highlighting them, but Stepping away and thinking, okay, I don't remember how many subjects that were, I'll go back and check that, maybe make a note and okay, they did this, then they did that, and then it's Crystallized. And as I say this, I realize of course this should work. This is the way that the brain learns, but somehow that's not the way we are taught to learn.</blockquote>

### [35:36] Deliberate Practice Secrets

### ‚ú® Summary
Deliberate practice involves pushing past comfortable limits by adding 20% to your current ability, focusing intensely on improvement rather than enjoyment. Professional musicians spend their practice time in a state of discomfort, aiming to achieve maximal growth. This approach contrasts with the concept of Flow, as deliberate practice requires concentration and effort, making the learning process challenging and sometimes painful. While some advocate for a constant state of Flow in all activities, the key to mastery lies in deliberate practice and the willingness to embrace the discomfort of pushing beyond one's current abilities.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>So I wrote a book 10 years ago, where I was trying to figure out as part of it, how do people get better at things. And so I spent time with a professional guitar player. I just wanted to see how he practiced. Like, what does this actually look like? What I learned from them is like, what they do is, yeah, they have the music in front of them. But for them, it's all speed. So they take a piece. He was working on licks for he was a new acoustic style player and they had these kind of bluegrassy type licks. And he probably had to memorize and he knew how fast he could comfortably play it. For them, it's all about adding 20% to what they're comfortably doing. And then that push passed through there comfortable. And the thing I remember writing about him was he was concentrating so hard to try to hit this lick 20% faster than he was used to it as he'd forget the breathe. So he'd be like, going, going, going, and then just gasp, you know, like his body would, you know, force him to breathe. So yeah, there it seemed to be all about deliberate practice. So like, how do you they don't waste any time professional musicians waste no time doing things they're comfortable doing. Every time they spend practicing, and this is also incredibly difficult. But every time they spend practicing is almost entirely in a state of, I'm not comfortable with this. But if I focus as hard as I can, maybe I'm going to pull this off. Like I'll pull off the sonata at this new speed I'm trying to do. Maybe I'll pull it off. It's like the maximal growth stimulating state. And so I wrote in the in this chapter, why was he so much better at guitar than I was at the same age, because I played a lot of guitar when I was younger and was in rock bands, right? And this kid was young, right? But really, really good. And I said, okay, now I realize it. I can recognize me when I look back at my time playing guitar at his age, I played stuff I knew how to play. Like that's what was fun. Like, yeah, I want to like jam along with the songs I knew, or, you know, rip some pentatonic scales, you know, to like a Jimi Hendrix album. It was fun. And he spent almost no time the pro spent no time having fun. Practicing was your brain had to be, you know, uncomfortable. So I learned a lot from that, you know, this actually led to a bit of a battle because of my readers, there was this a this battle that emerged where people were trying to combine Anders Ericsson and deliberate practice with Mihaly Chinkzittmihai and Flow. And really, they were trying to make Flow apply everywhere. Like it's all about Flow, deliberate practices, Flow, everything is Flow, the whole thing is to get into a state of Flow. And I remember Anders talking about this at some point and say like, no, no, no, like the state of practice that makes you better. It's the opposite of Flow, right? And Flow, you lose track of time. When you're practicing like that professional guitar player, you know, every second it passes by because it's like incredibly difficult. Like what you're doing, your mind is rebelling. It's not natural, you know, it's not fun. It's not the skier going down the hill and it's all instinct. It's you, it's all you thinking about exactly what you're trying to do. And so, you know, I began to push this point out here is like, it's not all about Flow, like actually getting better at things is really painful sometimes. Deliberate practice is not the same as Flow. And there's a lot of fights about this for a while. I think there's a lot of Flow advocates that just wanted life to be Flow all the time. But I think Anders was right because I watched these professionals practice. Like that's what it is. It's not fun.</blockquote>
