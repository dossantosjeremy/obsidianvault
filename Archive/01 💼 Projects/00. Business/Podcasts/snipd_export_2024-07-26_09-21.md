<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Entrepreneurship is your chance to build your work around your life, not be swallowed up by it. The problem is, as an entrepreneur and maybe a spouse or a parent as well, you have a ton of stuff pulling at you from moment to moment. That constant chaos keeps you from consistently winning your days. It is one of the greatest impediments to achieving fun and fulfillment. When you can't focus, you lose control. So how do we prevent ourselves from losing focus our goals or losing control of our lives? Let's design a checklist to regain your focus and I'll show you mine. Dream your checklist. Imagine your best year ever. Close your eyes. Picture eating chipotle with all the guacamole you want. You're making freedom number. You spend half your day researching plants because you love it. And you get to live in multiple places. Your dreams can become reality only if you think about what you really want. Here's an excerpt from my recent dream year.

You are going to start by writing down how you'd love this year to turn out for you. This dream year isn't just, I'm gonna have a nice house and my business will rock it. Include the specifics, where you are living, what you are doing, how you feel, where you traveled to, etc. This is to inspire you about all the things you can do in your life. Then really dial in the ones that feel important to you. I found it also helps me to dream bigger. Damn, I can do all these inspiring things! Remember, this is a dream year. That means dreaming big and not worrying about the how. All you are doing right now is creating a vision for the year that fills you with excitement. Once you have a clear picture of your dream year, then you can focus on making it come true.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Visit a mountain biking city, Asheville, Sun Valley, Jackson Hole, Sedona. Trip with parents and brother. Key things about your goals. Don't worry about doing everything in your dream year. Really think about which ones would excite you. My rule of thumb is if you are hesitating on the dream, then it shouldn't make your goals list. I don't always accomplish everything on my lists every year and that's okay. This list is to help you prioritize your time, which we'll talk about next. You can schedule and make sure you are working towards the things you really want to do. Over the past 10 years, I've tried to set up super aggressive goals. But I have found that it is better to aim for more sustainable goals. It's more impressive to find and stick with something than burnout after being impressive for one year. This list works for you, not the other way around. If mid -year you realize something doesn't matter, change it. I aim to review and update this list only twice a year. The best way to make sure you accomplish your goals is to see them often. Here's where I put mine. On the lock screen of my phone. On a sticky on my computer, on a text file that I look at each week, on the mirror of my bathroom, on a daily note that I read every day.</blockquote>

Blue equals work, green equals health, purple equals personal, and yellow equals travel. What color coding does is help me look at my calendar and see, am I spending my biggest blocks of time toward my goals? One glance gives me an immediate snapshot of the alignment of my work and priorities, and the mix of each day. This may stress you out or feel like extra work to do this system. Great, throw it away. I don't care how you organize your time. I care that you prioritize your time to work on the goals you have in your life. This gives me the opportunity to look at my calendar and say, my stated priority is to build my YouTube audience to 500 ,000. So why is there so little blue and allocate more to it. Pro tip. Front load your priorities, meaning if your main goal is YouTube, focus on it earlier in the week to make sure you're getting done what matters most. I get tired as the week goes on, so I put my most important tasks on Monday and Tuesday.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I get tired as the week goes on, so I put my most important tasks on Monday and Tuesday. How to prioritize the important tasks you can accomplish your goals. I asked Neville what he did all day and he said he watched The Simpsons and played guitar. Flabbergasted, huh? You just sat around your house and did nothing all day? The guilt and anxiety that would have created me is astronomical. The reality of the situation is, Neville prioritizes his week accordingly, sets up systems to make sure the right things get done in his business and lives his life the way he wants, Not others. Here are the questions I use to prioritize my time. 1. How do I pick what to actually do each week? Every Sunday, spend 15 minutes looking over the past week and setting my tasks for the next one. This is your chance to revisit your yearly goals and choose activities each week to move you closer toward your goals. Two, how do I know if these tasks are moving me in the right direction of my goal? During my Sunday review I also take my previous Sunday's goals and see how I did against them. This is my chance to evaluate if it moved the needle toward my yearly goal. It's not to judge or shame yourself, but to keep yourself accountable and continually improve.</blockquote>

You're going to get frustrated and lonely as an entrepreneur. That comes with a title. So you have got to have the right group around you. Other entrepreneurs who get the unique path you are walking. Especially starting out solo, you need to create your own social infrastructure for support, partnership, learning, and accountability. Let me show you three ways to meet the right people to help you on your business journey. One, get an accountability buddy. We make better choices and work harder when someone else is observing our behavior. Researchers call it the Hawthorne effect. I call it my number one productivity hack.

### ‚ú® Summary

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>And since then, we've all become good friends and they helped me in everything I've achieved. Remember, it is not about where they are today as much as where you think they are going. I still reach out to ambitious people all the time. A few years ago, I contacted Harry Dry from Marketing Examples. A young kid from England, I loved what he was doing with this newsletter, offering great marketing case studies copywriting tips. I love connecting with interesting people like him and this relationship creates a great opportunity to help each other now and in the future connect with no expectations. Today Harry has 100,000 subscribers on his email list, 30,000 LinkedIn followers and 140,000 on Twitter. He's doing epic and we're friends. It would have been harder to connect now, but I got him as a pre -fluencer, so it was simple, just like with Ramit Sethi and Tim Ferriss. Here are three principles to help you find pre -fluencers. One, who's doing work you are impressed by? Two, and who doesn't have a ton of attention and is likely to reply? Three, and what can you do to help this person? Challenge. Connect with a prefluencer.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Building a successful and influential network requires aiming to connect with individuals who are significantly better than oneself. By setting a goal to meet five new people every day for six months, one can expand their network and open doors to opportunities. Persistently reaching out, following up, and asking for referrals are key strategies in networking. Sending a post-meeting thank you email with highlights from the conversation, follow-ups, to-dos, and requests to meet more people can further solidify connections and build a strong network.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Andrew Chen is one of the most well -known executives in Silicon Valley, a VC partner at Andreessen Horowitz which specializes in games, AR, VR, Metaverse, and other cool stuff. But back in 2007, I was the only person Andrew knew when he moved to the Bay Area as a 23 -year -old. When he arrived, Andrew knew he needed to widen his network to achieve his dreams and be successful. As an ambitious 20 -something, Andrew wanted to find people 10 times better than him. To build his network, Andrew set a goal. Meet five new people per day for my first six months in the Bay Area. In less than a year, Andrew was associated with high profile people like venture capitalist Mark Andreessen, co -founder of Netscape, and entrepreneur Eric Yuan, the founder of Zoom. And through that strategy, he became a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most respected venture capital firms in the world. His strategy amounted to persistently reaching out, following up, and asking for referrals. After meeting someone new, Andrew would send him a thank you email. In it, he would include highlights from the chat he found interesting, follow ups and to -dos, requests to meet more people. Want to try the same in your city?

Starting with actions that don't scale is key to success. Personalized introduction emails with key points about oneself, the value one can provide, and the excitement to meet the recipient are crucial for building successful connections. Including why you are interesting, how you can help, and why you want to meet the person is essential for getting a response. Subject lines should grab the reader's attention with a strong hook, like a mutual connection.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Damn. To be successful, you need to start with things that don't scale. Great quote you mentioned. Companies to watch for are mutual mobile, on it, and backlinko. Super grateful. I'm curious. Are there one to two other people you believe I should meet? Thanks again, Andrew. When he got a new list of people to meet, Andrew would send an intro email with three key points. Short blurb about himself. Value he could provide, that is to say, what's in it for them? Why he was excited to meet them. He'd send this to everyone he was introduced to, personalizing to the entrepreneur or VIP he wanted to meet. And you can do the same. Telling someone why you are interesting, how you can help, and why you wanna meet works like gangbusters. If you fail to include these points for the person you're reaching out to, expect to be ignored. Let's check out an actual email Andrew sent and I'm going to comment on some key points. Subject. Steve Smith told me about you. Your subject line needs to grab the reader with your strongest hook, in this case a mutual connection.
