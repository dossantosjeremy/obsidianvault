### ‚ú® Summary
Recognize and capitalize on existing demand rather than trying to create demand for something seemingly exciting. Examples like a professional line sitter and social media influencer demonstrate the success of tapping into existing needs. Success lies in serving customers and meeting existing demand, even if the business idea is not conventionally thrilling.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Take New York City's professional line sitter, Robert Samuel. After getting fired from his customer service job at AT &T, he noticed the frenzy created by every new iPhone release. So he put an ad on Craigslist in 2012 to validate whether anyone would pay him to wait in line. When he was paid $325 for his first 15 hour stint, he knew he had a wave. Today, his business, Same Old Line Dudes, sold, employs 30 dudes and dudettes. Charging a $50 minimum up to 2 hours and $25 for each additional hour, to wait in line for everything from hot new sneakers to the DMV to the newest iPhone release. And Robert himself takes home $80 ,000 a year. There are countless waves you can ride that have nothing to do with tech. Cody Sanchez has gained over 1 million followers on social media because she teaches people how to own and operate boring businesses, like vending machines and RV rentals. A good wave isn't about being cool. It's about having customers. What I am saying here is that your job is not to create demand for something that seems exciting. It is to find existing demand and satisfy it.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That gave me a much easier opportunity to create a $65 million revenue business. Now, it won't always be that easy. Not a lot of private businesses publish their sales data, but there are plenty of other ways to make sure you're surfing a good wave. The rule here, in order to have a million dollar business, you need a million dollar opportunity. It's that simple. Thing is, how do you prove you have one? Too often aspiring entrepreneurs think they need spreadsheets and extensive research to figure this out. These are just a distraction. Let me show you a better way. Here's a market opportunity exercise. Say you have a beard, or love someone who does. The problem? Beards are itchy. Before you spend months of tinkering to create the world's greatest beard oil, let's figure out if you can really make a million dollars from this idea. See if there's a business here. There are two key questions to answer to make sure it's a million dollar opportunity. One, is the overall market dying, flat, or growing? You want flat or ideally growing. Is this a million dollar opportunity? To figure that out, we have to know the number of potential customers and the price of your product. First, I would check to see if there are enough customers who'd want to buy your beard oil.</blockquote>

Facebook is pretty much the entire world, and what's phenomenal is that they actually let you type in the keyword of whatever business category you're about and see the approximate Audience size. You can also use the Facebook ads library to see every single active ad running on Facebook for your keyword and location, which is super helpful for uncovering competitors and getting Ideas for your own marketing efforts.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Using tools like targeting specific groups, calculating potential market size, and determining if the business idea can generate at least a million dollars are crucial steps in evaluating a business opportunity. By selecting the right price point and estimating the number of ideal customers, one can quickly assess if the venture has the potential to be a million dollar business. Applying this evaluation to the beard oil idea can help determine its viability and success.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Not bad. And for beard oil, something like two and a half million people. Score! Now, you can also use these tools to focus on even more specific angles. For instance, take some other groups you can of targeting. Locals. Beard owners in local cities. More niche. Narrow interest groups like ingrown facial hair. Demographics based. African American beard owners. Step two. Is this a million dollar opportunity? When I was starting my Ninja discount card at UC Berkeley, there were only 25,000 plus students on campus, and I was confident I could sell my discount card for $10 each. At best, this could be a $250 ,000 business only if I was perfect. If I expanded to all the major college campuses in California, I could reach a student market of 1 million. It was clear this could easily create a million dollar business. Here are the major things you're looking for. Pick a price point you think will be ideal for your customer. Multiply that by the number of ideal customers. Does that equal at least a million dollars? Yes or no? Simple! Now, let's evaluate that on our Beard Oil idea.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Analyzing the market size and interest is crucial in determining the potential success of a business idea. Even with a product priced at $20 and a market of a thousand people, the total value may only reach $20,000, indicating limited growth potential. Identifying enough demand is essential for a business idea to be considered a million-dollar one. Utilizing the one-minute business model to assess revenue, cost, and profit is key to understanding the feasibility of making a million dollars through the business idea.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Google Trends. Little interest and no growth. Size of market? A thousand people. Cost of your product, 20 bucks. Total value, $20 ,000. Million dollar idea, no. I'm sorry if you love making fub broth and want to deliver it, but I wouldn't touch this business idea because I don't see enough demand for it. It could be a fun passion project, but it is not a million dollar business. All you want to know is if the business idea is worth pursuing. Now that we know it's worth it, let's confirm exactly how you're going to get your million dollars. To do that, we'll use the one minute business model. Step three, the one minute business model. Many people have asked me to review their business plan. I always give the same advice. Your plan is to make money. Realistically, you are not going to get 5 or 10% of this market. But now let's see what it would take to generate your own $1 million in profit. Revenue minus cost equals profit. These determine if you can make your first million dollars. Revenue, all the money you make, minus cost, how much it costs to make it, equals profit, what you get to take home. This is obviously extremely basic, but that's the point.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Revenue minus cost equals profit. By making rough estimates and focusing on key financial aspects like profit per unit, one can easily calculate the number of units needed to reach a specific revenue target, such as making a million dollars. It is essential to prioritize the basic calculations first to understand the potential of a business and worry about the details later.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Revenue, all the money you make, minus cost, how much it costs to make it, equals profit, what you get to take home. This is obviously extremely basic, but that's the point. It is all you need to calculate in order to assess whether you can get to one million dollars. Let's plug in some numbers to see how it works, continuing with our beard oil example. Our beard oil sells for $50. The cost to make it, package and ship it? Around $37 .50. Our profit per unit sold then becomes $12 .50. You may be worrying about advertising costs, optimal pricing, manufacturers, what happens when all your customers' beards look so gorgeous. I know. This is the fear in you worrying about too many things. What we are looking for are rough estimates. Momentum is your friend, and we can sweat the details later. For now, let's focus on the -level stuff to see the potential in your business. If you're able to earn $12 .50 in profit for every unit sold, then it's easy to calculate how many you'll need to sell to make a million dollars. You just divide your target profit, $1 million, by the profit per unit sold, $12 .50. That will equal your total sales needed of 80,000 units.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Maximizing profit involves spotting adjacent opportunities, like increasing the average order value by selling longer subscriptions. By adjusting revenue dials such as average order value, frequency, price point, customer type, product line, and add-on services, one can significantly impact the success of the business and achieve profit targets efficiently.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Just keep your eyes open for adjacent opportunities. The easiest way for me to reach my goal was to increase the average order value by selling longer term subscriptions to businesses. My one minute business model changed to this. I could sell six month subscriptions for $120. The product would cost me $60. The shipping would cost me $30. That meant for every order my profit is now $30. I needed to make only 33 sales, $1 ,000 target profit divided by the $30 profit per order to make this happen. Way more doable than a target of 200. By tweaking the revenue dials, I could potentially make Sumo Jerky work. Here are the six revenue dials you can use. One. Average order value. Increase the amount someone purchases. 2. Frequency. Increase how often someone will buy your service. 3. Price point. Increase or decrease your price point to affect total sales. 4. Customer type. Approach a more lucrative slash wealthier customer segment. Five, product line, add additional products to make the business more attractive to start. And six, add on services.</blockquote>
