### [02:49] Test Your Market's Willingness to Pay

### ‚ú® Summary
By verifying the potential of an idea that has brought in a substantial revenue and profit, the focus shifts to testing the market's inclination to spend on the product. This step is crucial as it determines if an idea can transition into a successful business. Many seemingly great ideas may not materialize until the target market's willingness to pay is evaluated through testing, as highlighted by the speaker's experience in launching AppSumo.

Be worried when it's the other way around. I searched and contacted people via Google and Instagram to sell me their jerky at the prices I had listed. Now at this point, you have successfully verified that your own idea has million dollar potential. Now it's time to test whether people will actually spend money on your product. This step is critical. A lot of your ideas will seem great in theory, but you will never know if they can go from idea to business until you actually test your target market's willingness to pay. For instance, when I was launching AppSumo, I wasn't 100% convinced people wanted to buy software deals online similar to Groupon.</blockquote>

The AppSumo validation worked really well, since I discovered the power of validating when founding AppSumo, I've used the validation process for every business venture I've started, Including SumoJurkey. What I discovered using the validation process was that once you understand it, you can apply it to any and every business idea, no how small or trivial. Every potential business idea can be instantly verified, like your own magic wand. The benefits of validation are immediate and critical. One, you don't waste time. Two, you save money. Three, you find out if you can get customers for your idea. Four, you get money upfront. Five, you light a fire under your butt to get moving. And by saving time and money, validation will ultimately allow you to test as many of your ideas as possible.</blockquote>

### [05:08] The Golden Rule of Validation

### ‚ú® Summary
Validating your idea by finding three customers in 48 hours who will pay for it is a powerful method that saves time and money, allowing you to test multiple ideas quickly and efficiently. This approach drives creativity, forces quick iteration, and eliminates self-doubt, leading to successful validation within a short time frame.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Four, you get money upfront. Five, you light a fire under your butt to get moving. And by saving time and money, validation will ultimately allow you to test as many of your ideas as possible. Theoretically, you can test 52 ideas per year, comfortably, but that's not necessary because this method will likely take you only 3 -5 weekends at most before you strike gold. The Golden Rule of Validation Much like the validation process my monthly 1K students made me use for SumoJurkey to validate, I turned to the golden rule of validation. Find three customers in 48 hours who will give you money for your idea. Success means moving quickly and spending no money. And that's what makes the golden rule of validation so effective. Here is why it works so well. You're allowed only 48 hours. Limitations breed creativity. Having a tight time limit will cut off the doubting entrepreneur inside you and force you to iterate fast and be creative until you find something that works. Get your first customers.</blockquote>

### [05:53] Golden Rule of Validation

### ‚ú® Summary
Success in validation comes from moving quickly and spending no money. The golden rule of validation emphasizes a tight time limit of 48 hours, pushing entrepreneurs to iterate fast and be creative. The focus is on getting the first customers, starting from friends to family and then the challenging third customer. Collecting money upfront is crucial to validate an idea effectively, as the promise of payment is not enough. Real money from real people using platforms like PayPal and Stripe validates an idea effectively.

Having a tight time limit will cut off the doubting entrepreneur inside you and force you to iterate fast and be creative until you find something that works. Get your first customers. Your first customer is a friend, the second customer is someone in your family, but your third customer is hard. You think this is easy? Then get three customers. Don't worry about building a business. We are only validating your idea. And if it is this hard now, it'll only get harder. Collect money upfront. The promise of payment is not validation. That's polite rejection. Getting customers to hand over their dollars makes it real. But you need to get real money from real people. Services like PayPal, Stripe, CashApp, and Venmo make collecting it easy these days. The point is, if you can get someone to give you money quickly just by describing a product or solution, you're good.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>That two -sentence pitch built him a $750 ,000 a year business. Or take what happened to Dana, a typical entrepreneur who enrolled in a monthly 1K course to start a horse industry business. She turned away from building a costly app and used the pre -selling method to quickly and cheaply validate instead. Here is the exact conversation that changed her perspective. Dana, I'm doing a horses business. We are launching in four months. Going to do this thing with horses and trainers and then I have a guy who's a professional. Noah. Okay. Dana. Yeah, so we are looking for a developer and funding to build our prototype. Noah, okay, so what is the actual problem you are solving? Dana. Well, I've taken a ton of Skillshare classes, I'm doing customer research, and we are working with the developer to get the site launched in four months. Noah, again, what is the actual problem you are solving? Dana, we want to help teach people how to take care of horses. Noah, yes! Now we are getting somewhere. So what do people do today and what's wrong with it? Dana, the YouTube videos are crappy.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The key to starting a successful business is testing the market before investing in a full-blown website or application. By contacting potential customers directly through messages, like in horse groups, and offering expertise, entrepreneurs can validate their business idea and make their first dollars without the need for a company bank account or LLC. This approach allows entrepreneurs to quickly identify their ideal customers and achieve quick revenue growth.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Noah, yes! Now we are getting somewhere. So what do people do today and what's wrong with it? Dana, the YouTube videos are crappy. Horse people have tons of money and don't have access to great knowledge. Noah, snaps! So how can you prove that people will actually pay to have this problem solved? Dana, I can message people in my horse groups and friends to see if they'll give me money for that expert knowledge. No, now we are talking. Dana officially made her first dollar, actually $1 ,000 the first week she went live with her test by messaging friends and people in her horse group. She didn't need a full blown website or application to start the business. Heck, she didn't even have a company bank account or an LLC corporation, just a PayPal account for the first few months. Your dream 10 list for pre -selling. You learned about the customer first approach in chapter three. Now, using that knowledge, we are going to create the first 10 people you're going to contact for pre selling. Your aim is to determine which ones are likely to be the easiest to be your ideal customers. With them, you'll get the fastest zero to $1.</blockquote>

Ask open-ended questions like 'What's the most frustrating thing currently?', 'How would X improve your life?', and 'What should X cost?'. Summarize their responses to ensure understanding. Utilize 'what' or 'how' questions for open dialogue instead of limiting 'why' or 'yes or no' questions.

### ‚ú® Summary
Presenting your offer as a comparison can make it easier for your customer to understand. Research shows that we better understand the world when something is presented as a contrast with something else. When validating sales, ask for money and ask people to pay immediately rather than just asking for interest. Get comfortable with potentially selling a product before making it and clearly explain the delivery timeline to set clear expectations.

Everyone's interested until they have to pay. That's why you don't ask, would you be interested? When you're validating. I've had a lot of people say they're interested and then not pay. No, you ask for money and ask people to pay immediately. Now a warning, when you validate you have to get comfortable with potentially selling a product before you've actually made it. Clearly explain when it will be delivered because people are fine with giving you money in advance as long as you set clear expectations.</blockquote>

Present offers as a comparison to improve customer understanding. Requesting money is more effective than inquiring about interest.

### ‚ú® Summary
Contrasting concepts provide a better understanding of the world. People often show interest until payment is involved, hence it's crucial to ask for payment upfront during validation. Clearly communicate delivery timelines when asking for money. Offering discounted rates with a time limit can incentivize immediate action. A proactive approach is to solicit feedback from initial customers to consistently enhance oneself and the business. While immediate success may not always be guaranteed, direct pre-selling for validation purposes is a valuable strategy.

When I get shot down while validating, I have a simple four question script that flips the no into new knowledge, new ideas, and maybe even new customers. One, why not? It is really easy to get scared from attacking this one head on, because what happens if their criticism is right? But that's exactly what you want to know. Two, who is one person you know who would really like this? Always, always, always ask for a referral. Be specific about what kind of referral and use a number.</blockquote>

Despite expecting a quick success like Mondo, the speaker's idea was not well-received, even by close friends.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>There's a limited -edition movie poster company called Mondo that gets local artists to redesign movie posters and produce a limited number of the reinvented posters for sale. Mondo tweets when a new poster becomes available and sells out within a few minutes. So here was my idea. Limited edition posters of tacos from local restaurants. Instant million dollar business idea, right? I always consider which color Ferrari I'll buy when I have these ideas. This was going to be easy. Mondo was already doing a similar idea. Plus, I knew artists and restaurants would promote the taco posters to their fan base, and within minutes everything would be sold out. You can probably see where this is going. Then I reached out to some good friends who I know love tacos and pitched the idea of a taco poster for 25 bucks. The responses I got. Uh, so you want me to buy a print for $25 of a... Taco? I'll pass. Yeah, not my thing, Noah. No one loves tacos as much as you do. Obviously, I was disappointed not even my close friends would buy a limited edition taco print. Every time I got rejected, I'd ask the person my four questions. One, why not? Two, who is one person you know who would really like this? Three, what would make this a no -brainer for you? Four, what would you pay for that?</blockquote>

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Like, what does a shirt like that cost? $20? $30? That was the one thing that kept coming up. A specific taco shirt of mine that always got me an insane amount of attention from everyone. Time for validation experiment numero I texted the same friends and called others and asked, you know that taco shirt I wear? Would you want one? Here are the responses I got. Hell yeah, hook it up. Give me now. Show me the tacos. Next, I posted a picture of me and the shirt on Facebook and posted a price of $25 per shirt.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Try to direct message, DM people, or whatever enables you to get the fastest response time possible. The second method to validate any business idea, Marketplaces. A classic way to validate your product is to use Marketplaces. Sites like Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, Reddit, or whatever you have locally. The great thing about a marketplace is you have a ton of people who are looking to spend money. It is a reliable way to validate different business ideas you're thinking of. Example. My good bud Neville wanted to validate whether people would pay to rent expensive cameras. He posted one for rent on Craigslist and was able to get $75 for it in a few hours. This simple validation cost $0 in a few minutes of his time. This is so much better versus building a website, figuring out a domain, designing a logo, trying to find customers, etc. I also often use a simple virtual product process on marketplace sites to test products that don't even exist yet. I find an item similar to the one I want to validate or I drop a quick and dirty design of what I want to sell, and then I post it to the marketplace along with a price to see if there's an audience.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Validating a business idea through landing pages can be done efficiently by setting up a simple landing page using affordable tools like Instapage, Unbounce, or ClickFunnels, and running ads to gauge interest. However, this approach can be time-consuming and costly, requiring expertise in advertising. To streamline the process, limit the work to 48 hours to avoid wasting time and money. An effective example is highlighted with the case of Kettle and Fire, where a basic landing page was set up quickly and affordably using Unbounce and Fiverr for logo design.

As an example of how to do a landing page right, take what my former intern Justin Mayors did while validating what would become the successful bone broth company, Kettle and Fire. To start, he bought the domain bonebroth .com for 12 bucks and set up a basic landing page using Unbounce. Justin paid around $5 on Fiverr to come up with a simple logo.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Starting with a simple landing page and a basic logo, Justin priced his bone broth at $29.99 for 16 ounces. Without a refined website or extensive marketing, he directed customers to a PayPal checkout. By investing in Bing ads and focusing on sales rather than perfecting design or marketing strategies, he quickly generated nearly $500 in revenue. This simplified approach eventually led to the success of Kettle & Fire, now a $100 million business. The key takeaway is to prioritize sales over perfecting the product details, website design, or advertising strategies when testing a business idea.

He decided he could make a profit if he charged $29 .99 for 16 ounces. If people were willing to give a stranger nearly $30 for a pint of a product they never tasted or even seen, then it was probably destined for success. At the site, people who hit order now got sent to a PayPal checkout, where they were asked to send money to Justin's email address for beef marrow bone broth. The site was ugly enough to give graphic designers the cold sweats, but after Justin bought about $50 of Bing ads, people started actually coming to the site and PayPal -ing him money! Over the course of the two -week test, he netted almost $500 in revenue. And now, Kettle & Fire is a $100 million company selling broth. Validated. The key is if you go this route, don't overthink the design, the name, the language, the ads, or any of that. Just focus on seeing if you can get people to buy your product.</blockquote>
