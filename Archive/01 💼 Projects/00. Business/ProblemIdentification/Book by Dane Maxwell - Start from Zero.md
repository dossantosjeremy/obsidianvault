To start, he needed proper business 101 training. He needed to find someone with a problem to build a business around. So he started talking to business owners and asking them questions to find the pain. He asked them a powerful question, “What do you use Microsoft Excel for in your business?”

Microsoft Excel is a hotbed for potential products because companies use it to cobble together solutions for their various business needs. (There are many questions you can ask to find the pain, which you will learn later in this book. This is just one example question.) One particular business owner was using Excel to track important financial metrics across four different locations in their industry. The resulting setup was pretty archaic.

Then Carl asked a second question, “How does that process work for you right now?” This question put the business owner in story mode and allowed Carl to really connect with the issue by hearing the dirty details of the problem.

So then Carl asked, “What would your dream solution be?”

Now Carl has a new business idea. Did he get it from being an expert? No. He got it from helping someone else and knowing the questions to ask. 		 		He didn’t come up with either the problem or the solution. His customer just told him both.

Carl continued working full-time while his product was being built by someone else. 		 		As for the user interface design, instead of hiring someone else to do that work and giving them another 10% of the future revenues, he did that part himself. But he could have hired that out as well.

Did he need money to start? No. He just needed to ask questions and then find an expert to create a solution. 		 		In this case, he met his developer at work. But a quick Google search for “find a reliable software developer” will return plenty of sites with Amazon.com-type reviews for developers you can trust. 		 		What is Carl’s risk so far? 		 		He didn’t come up with an idea. 		He didn’t write code for his product. 		He didn’t use any money.



Carl lives in California, which is in the Pacific time zone. He would wake up at 6:00 a.m. each morning and talk to business owners on the East Coast, where it was 9:00 a.m. (three hours later). He did this all on purpose. He’d call up businesses and send emails, asking the owners about their painful problems for an hour and a half each morning. After two months, he had five really good ideas to pick from. He reviewed his ideas and picked the easiest and most profitable idea to build.

He’d send messages like this: “Hey there! I’m contacting a group of business owners to ask them about the really painful problems they face. My intention is to build a new business around a real problem instead of guessing. What sort of painful problems do you face on a day-to-day basis that you wish could be removed?”

Then he learned about the significant power of limiting beliefs. He took one full day to work on all of his limiting beliefs and transformed them using a four-question process called The Work by Byron Katie (find it free online and give it a shot).

Let me give you another quick example of what’s possible with an online course. They are much simpler to build, but the process is the same. To get started, we need to identify a painful problem that can be solved. Personally, I started by observing the people around me. I noticed that many of them had issues completing their goals. 		 		And they were in pain from it.

To do that, I wrote a Facebook post that said, “Does anyone here struggle with any mindset issues? I’m thinking about making a course on this. Send me a private message or comment below—I’d like to chat with you.”

Five people reached out. I got brave and asked them about their mindset issues—I was nervous that people wouldn’t want to talk about something so personal. I’d say, “Thanks for contacting me. What are your current problems with mindset that you’d like to change?”


This expert said, “Yes.” 		 		In a short while, I had found someone to help my new customers with their pain. 		 		Once I had my expert, I sold a 12-week mindset course to these customers. We called the first version of the course, “What’s In The Way Is The Way: A Counterintuitive Approach to a Squeaky Clean Mind.” 		 		I went to my list of interested people and told them, “Hey, I’ve got an expert who can help with focusing. We are going to teach a 12-week course to solve this problem for you. Are you interested?” 		 		The original four out of five people purchased it. Which was really good

So, that is the great “secret.” You connect with another human and listen to them. Once you’ve done that, you find and put experts in place to solve their problems and share the revenue. If you can do that, you’ll be set for life.

You don’t have to be an expert anymore. You just need to find painful problems and solve them for others. Think of entrepreneurship more like being a detective and a problem solver.

Creativity. 		Social Self-Esteem. 		Diligence. 		Fairness. 		Altruism



Don’t consider yourself creative? Creativity can be built. Pick up a book on creativity and practice the exercises inside. Look up creativity books on Amazon and find a 5-star book.

Not outgoing with high social self-esteem? Join Toastmasters in your area and practice public speaking. To get started just Google “toastmasters in my [city].”

There’s a book called SNAP: How To Change Your Personality In 30 Days, which will help.


### Ask yourself the following 

What do I want to do for myself?” is a good starting point.

Step 1 – Place a hand on your heart, so it knows you are there with it. 		 		Step 2 – Breath in a sense of value into your heart. 		 		Step 3 – Say: “Hello, heart that I love, what is it you desire with all your being?”

Now, let’s drill even deeper into the same question and add a specific context around this blanket desire. 		 		Step 1 – Place a hand on your heart so it knows you are there with it. 		Step 2 – Breathe a sense of value into your heart. 		Step 3 – Say: “Hello, heart that I love. What is it you desire in regards to finances?” 		My answer is, “to provide for my family.”



With this framework, you repeat the question “What’s most important?” until you’ve dug all the way down to the root. Usually, you’ll need to ask the question five to seven times. 		 		Make sure to use the word “what” instead of “why.” 		“What” uncovers motivation. 		“Why” uncovers justification. 		

Our conscious motivations are usually general and simple but don’t hold enough juice for us to take action on. Things like, “Oh, I want freedom,” “I don’t want a boss,” or “I’m tired of being poor.”

Make sure you are in a quiet place.
		Put your hand on your heart.
		Take a deep breath.
		Say out loud, “I feel this shame as totally real and not really who I am deep down.”
		Let out any sounds or movements necessary until you feel complete.


And this little belief will keep a person in a bad business, an incompatible relationship, or a crappy job. Try saying it outloud and see if it rings true. “I only have one chance to be successful.” 		 		Give yourself a little love if you feel that one. We can clear it later.

From my experience, I’ve seen that there are two issues that will sabotage you. The first is the beliefs you hold. The second is the identity—“who” you think you are… the person behind all of the beliefs.

And you can try our wonderful process to unblock yourself for free at StartFromZero.com/DJP.


In this step you ask yourself, “Do I believe anything negative about [insert key desire of your heart right now]?”

You want to ask this about anything you are struggling to take action on. 		 		Here’s how the process went for me:

At A Time 		 		First, we are going back to Byron Katie’s five-step process called The Work. The Work consists of four questions and a turnaround statement. In this case, I am adding a sixth step to her process to include a step from my mindset mentor Brian Adler.

				Process With Additional Step 6

				6. Now go back and notice instead of believing both thoughts.


Prescribe: Create a Physical Reminder, Such as a Business Card, and Put the Reminder All Over Your Home 		Next, I went to Moo at StartFromZero.com/Moo and made cards, put them in my wallet, on my desk, and around my house. I breathe them in whenever I can to reprogram my state of mind and brain. 		



Here are a couple of questions you can ask to troubleshoot your motivation. 		 		Is there a belief I’m holding right now that’s causing me to lose motivation? 		Is there an identity or story I’m holding about myself that’s causing me to lose motivation? 		Am I just being lazy?

In closing, this can be very difficult and many times it helps to have training and facilitation. We have a free process that helps you do this at http://StartFromZero.com/DJP.




Subject: Could you help me? 		 		Hello [insert name], 		 		I found you online, and you seem like the kind of person who could help me. I’m looking for someone who can help me with the deeper issues that come up when pursuing a meaningful dream. 		 		I get stuck in my head. 		 		I’ve just recently made a declaration to [insert declaration], but it’s very scary for me, and I need some help with the fears, beliefs, and emotions that come up. 		 		I’ve done some deeper motivation reflection and found out my core motivation for [insert declaration] is to [insert deepest found motivation]. 		 		I have aligned my life in four core areas. My thoughts, feelings, environment, and schedule are all aligned to support this desire I have. 		 		But I know I will encounter deeper identity-level issues that are going to make it really hard at times. I know I’m human and will need help. 		 		That’s why I’m looking for a weekly coach to help me stay accountable and help me process the emotions, limiting beliefs, and identities that come up along the way. I’d like to work with you for 12 weeks to see if we could transform my blocks in that period of time. 		 		Would you be available for a chat? 		 		[Your name]



Make your heart’s declaration. 		Resolve the inner conflicts. 		Align your life in the four areas. 		Create your custom prescription. 		


Note: It’s also OK to just do one item at a time. Give yourself a week to go through it slowly. You can just do one item one day at a time. Make your heart’s declaration one day. Do the motivations another day. Resolve the inner conflicts another day. Etc…

After your morning routine, schedule your first 30 minutes to focus on your chief desire.

As a surveyor, you want to teach your brain to see the geographical foundation that every income stream sits on.

First, Examples 		 		The fastest way I know to build the surveyor brain is to apply pattern recognition to existing successful businesses using this framework: 		 		Customer. Pain. Solution. Offer. 		 		Who’s the Customer? 		What’s the Pain? 		What’s the Solution? 		What’s the Offer?

Breaking down businesses this way simplifies them to fit into our brain efficiently. There are three big concepts at play here. These concepts are what give you an excellent advantage. 		 		The first is pattern recognition. 		The second is applying a framework to organize information. 		The third is this actual framework: Customer, Pain, Solution, Offer. CPSO.

I repeat: Set up a business to take care of yourself first. Do not let yourself be fooled, this can be done in any business category.

Let me repeat; you should obsess over your business model until it takes great care of you. And you can do this in literally any industry. Here are the criteria for my most valuable businesses:

Automated sales (people sign up without speaking to me). 		Recurring revenue (people pay me monthly for years). 		I sell tools (instead of providing a service). 		I get paid upfront.

Many categories fit this mold. Selling courses, membership websites, gym memberships, and also software as a service (SaaS) fit these four criteria. SaaS is the most valuable business category as of 2020, it is what set me financially free. And although I get many people wanting to build a SaaS right away, SaaS is not a good first business; you’ll want to cut your teeth on something simpler first.

I learned about the importance of finding pain from my dear friend Andrew Warner of Mixergy.com. He interviewed 750 entrepreneurs to find this pattern. I highly recommend you check out his site.


I’m telling you this so you can focus on more groups of people. Everyone needs your help. Successful people, and unsuccessful. We all need help with something.

My favorite repeatable process for finding these painful seeds is The Five Question Framework we use at StartFromZero. 		 		We call this “idea extraction.”

Over the course of the last year, what has been your most persistent and present problem? 		How do you currently go about solving that problem? 		What happens if you don’t solve that problem? 		What would your dream solution be? (Or) If you could wave a magic wand how would you solve this problem? 		Would that be worth paying for, and if so, how much?

It can really help to niche this down to a certain topic for the first question. You could ask what’s your most persistent and present problem… 		 		In the morning? 		On your way to work? 		Just before bed? 		With your sleep? 		While you’re using your smartphone? 		On Facebook?

Customer — Uses A Mechanism — To Get A Result 		In this case it was... 		 		Customer: Online marketing friend. 		Result: A finished blog post. 		Mechanism: Hiring an editor.

I approached my conversations with an attitude of playful helpfulness. I told the two people I talked to that I didn’t have any expectations other than just getting clarity on something that’s troubling them.

The fifth question was the hardest. Even though I’m not selling anything (yet), I still get a little bit uncomfortable when talking about price and what someone would pay for something

Could you really be that close to having an income-scalable product? It is freaky how fast this can go. In Andrea’s case, she already had the expertise to make the product. This can be a great way to go for fast product creation. Rely on your own expertise. But if she didn’t, she could have found experts with knowledge in this area and organized the content for a profit split.

I didn’t have any expertise when I was starting out, so it was intimidating. When I asked real estate brokers about their painful problems, they told me about problems I didn’t know how to solve, so I had to find experts with that knowledge

The Humble Product Creator. 		 		It’s an art: of stripping things away. 		It’s a practice: of co-creation with your customer. 		It’s an intuition: for finding what seems off and coming into alignment with it. 		It’s an intention: of humility and truly helping another.


![[Apple Notes/Archive/Projects/Entrepreneurship/Image.png]]


Your goal is to refresh your mind as often as you need with these concepts when you start building the product. Even if you’re only able to follow half of these concepts and steps, you will still do better than most. 		 		Remember this: Your idea means absolutely nothing until it is fully realized and demonstrated.

Align your product to the C.P.S.O. 		Prototype the vision for the product (could be with pen and paper). 		Get buy-in, yes, or money from the customer. 		Find experts to create the product vision. 		Test the concept for results (without building it) or build now if confident. 		Structure the deal for limited financial risk. 		Create a communication loop so you’re always informed. 		Think about your goals and if this product meets them.

Does the customer currently do this activity outside of the product? 		(Best answer: Yes) 		Does it require a great change of behavior? 		(Best answer: No) 		Is the burden to use the product high? 		(Best answer: No) 		Does the product deliver an end result clearly? 		(Best answer: Yes)

These four killers can save your product’s life. 		 		If the customer does not currently perform this activity outside of the product, that means they will need to add a new behavior, which is not a safe bet. You want to make the things they already do easier, not give them new things to do. 		 		If your product requires a great change in behavior, you’re not safe. 		 		If the burden to use the product is too high, you’re not safe. 		 		If the product delivers an unclear end result, you’re in trouble with your marketing.



Step 5 – Test Concept for Result or Build if Confident 		I went straight into building it. I was too inexperienced to know better. A better way to go is to test the concept first before you risk building the entire product out. Testing the concept means you figure out how to hack a version together for one customer, to see if it works before you build it into a full-on system. You can Google “how to create minimum viable products” or “how to hack together a solution” for lots of training on this matter.


The idea came to me to ask my uncle if he’d pay for the development. He did the math of paying $100 a month for life or just paying $2200 to get it free forever. He chose to fund my project and get it free for life. I was only 22 and extremely nervous. I was so grateful.

Today, I created a communication loop by having my expert email me every day the answers to four questions. I learned these 4 questions from a mentor of mine Eben Pagan. 		 		 		How many hours did you work? 		What did you accomplish? (Not what you did; what did you accomplish?) 		What problems did you encounter? 		What questions do you have for me?

Step 8 – Think About Your Goals and if This Product Meets Them 		My goal was to make $10,000 a month, so if I were to land one hundred brokers at $100 a month, my goal would be met. All went well; I had a few hiccups, but they were nothing major. With great marketing using my gardener brain, that product made me over $700,000 over the span of five years. On average, it brought in over $100,000 a year.

The greatest products fully deliver the end result. They give something for next to nothing. Those are the greatest of products.

Subject: Impressed – want to hire you? 		 		Hi [NAME], I’ve been reading your posts on Google groups, and I am quite impressed. 		 		I think you could really make my app fly. It’s still in the planning phase, and I’d like to talk about hiring you. Rather than leave you completely in the dark before asking you to reply, I thought I’d tell you a little about it. 		 		The App works like this. (Then I linked to the story I wrote). 		 		What do you think? 		



In Regards to Finding Experts to Build Your Products 		 		People over complicate this. 		If you’re looking for an author to write a book… 		 		Go to Google and search “how to hire a writer for a book.” 		If you’re looking for a software developer… 		 		Go to Google and search “how to hire a software developer.” 		If you’re looking for someone to make you a skateboard…

Remember that you’re the one with the customers, the idea, and the end result the customers all want. That makes you the owner. The product is maybe 25% of the business, which is why we build it after we get the idea proven, not before. 		 		You can also see my top recommendations for job boards at 		StartFromZero.com/Yes.

As a humble product creator you will be doing this... 		 		Find Pain — Sell Pain — Find Expert — Get Solution Made — Watch Customer Use — Tweak Until Results Happen. 		 		I struggled with what business examples to fit into this section of the book.

Get the concept tested or built. 		Get it into the hands of your first customer. 		Get that first customer a result (treat them with the care of a newborn baby). 		Repeat with your next few customers. 		Get all of your customers’ results. 		Document the results as case studies and stories. 		Create one focused marketing process using your case studies to convert paying customers. 		Promote the case studies within the niche market. (Tip: Master a single traffic source first, before you expand.)

Use a single marketing process to sign up paying customers. 		I followed the Product Launch Formula by Jeff Walker to launch this business (links to his books and courses at StartFromZero.com/Yes), which I recommend. In essence, I had a landing page promising Realtors a system for getting more listings, leading to a series of five customer case studies demonstrating proof, ending with a link to a program details page for them to buy.

Promote those within the niche market (best to master one source of traffic first). 		I acquired an email list of agents and promoted their stories for the next four weeks.




# Promotion
The challenging trick is to find one traffic source that works and make full use of it in every way. That takes a little courage and experimentation. You could run Facebook ads, host webinars, run Google Ads, promote on YouTube, or write guest blog posts on popular blogs in the niche space. There are many options. The important thing is to share your customers’ positive results and stories on those channels.

And to use discernment for the best channel at the time. Back in 2008 that was email marketing. Then in 2013 it was the podcast segment. Now it’s mastering the news feed or cranking YouTube ads correctly. 		 		It’s pretty normal to feel fear when starting out on a new marketing channel. This is oddly tricky. First, you have to find one source that works. Second, you have to be smart enough to know it’s working and not dilute your focus elsewhere (I speak from experience).

<b><u>Imagine the simplicity and peace you’d have if you thought the following: “I’m going to find someone with pain, help them get a result with an expert, then find a few more people, help them get results, then I’m going to tell their stories to others in the same niche and build my business on one traffic source, just to get started.”</u></b>


This email template is responsible for generating roughly $250,000. I sent out emails like this when I was just getting started (not exact, but very close). 		 		Subject: Would you like one of these? 		 		Have you ever heard of Robb Spearman? He’s a RE/MAX owner in Iowa who just set up his very own AgentCareCenter for his agents. 		 		 			Here’s what it looks like. 		 		 		Robb was really happy with it. He just finished telling me... 		 		“My agents love the AgentCareCenter. It organizes everything they need to do business in one place, and best of all, it gives me an easy way to communicate with them.”

If you’d like one of these sites or want to know pricing, just reply, and I’ll help you get one set up. 		 		If not, I hope you enjoy your day! 		 		Thank YOU, 		— 		Dane Maxwell 		Phone 		Company name


Subject: [Direct personal question] 		 		Have you ever heard of [customer name]? They are x from y who just setup [product name]. 		 		[Insert direct link to specific result]. 		 		[Customer name] was really happy with it. They just finished telling me… 		 		[Insert customer testimonial that also addresses your target markets pain in the testimonial]. 		 		[Insert call to action with link to setup or reply to request more info]. 		 		[Positive sign off], 		[Name

This Works Because... Selling Proof Works. 		 		There is no better marketing mechanism I’ve found than demonstrating proof. That’s why you work so hard to get results with your first few customers. 		 		Start small—get a result for one person. Document the result. Promote it to others who are similar. 		

how the four brains will help you? 		 		First, learn to see the world in income streams (the Surveyor). 		 		Second, learn where to find seeds (ideas) and prepare the soil (the Tiller). 		 		Third, learn how to plant seeds (the Planter). 		 		Fourth, learn how to garden and grow the ideas (the Gardener).


Now, this is important. I would not look at competitors for very long, if at all; I would just go to work creating my solution, helping women, and talking to them instead. I don’t like looking for competition because it scares me out of action. I like staying with my customers instead. I think a lot of people go into research mode and then paralyze themselves. Stay focused on what keeps your business moving forward; there’s always room for another excellent solution.

Hey, I’m doing a process right now that helps me find awesome business ideas by asking about others’ biggest problems. Would you mind if I tried the process out with you for fun to see what we find? It takes five to ten minutes.” 		I’ve found this is a really fun way to connect with people. 		 		Then ask the five questions.

What is your most persistent and present problem today (or this week, month, year)? 		How are you going about solving that problem now? 		What happens if you don’t solve it? 		If you could wave a magic wand or have a dream solution, how would you solve it? 		Would that be worth paying for? If so, how much?


## Knowing how to sell

Using words that sell is the only skill you’ll ever need to make money. 		 		Think about this: if you only had the skill of using words that sell, you could just help sell other people’s products without making your own and take a cut.


[End Result a Customer Wants] + [In a Specific Period of Time] + [Addressing Objections] 		You could go out right now and help a friend’s business by plugging in the right words and then slapping them on the top of their website. So many businesses would benefit from using this headline.

I’ve used copywriting to write better emails in order to hire top software developers for my projects. Let me show you what I do. Here are the top pains and desires of a software developer. 		 		Pain: Unclear software projects that stress them out. 		Pain: Not being paid on time. 		Pain: Not working on projects that see the light of day. 		Pain: Not being respected for their talents and treated like mules.


Mail to developers 

Subject: I really respect what I’ve seen 		 		Hey there, I really respect what I’ve seen you building online, so I thought I’d take a chance and reach out. 		 		I’ve got a software project I’m working on with really clear specifications and a vision, and I was wondering if you’d like to see it? 		 		I understand payment can be delayed on many software projects, so I’d be sure to pay you within 48 hours of you sending the invoice.

This project has customers ready and waiting to use it, as well. 		 		Let me know if you’d like to hear more? 		— 		Daneq

Unbeknownst to her, you’ve just used another great copywriting formula. 		 		[How Would You Feel if You Got] [Insert Desire 1] & [Insert Desire 2], [Instantly], [ While Addressing Objection]!

Copywriting is a vast topic, and you can find a large collection of copywriting formulas online by Googling copywriting swipe files, top copywriting formulas, or top copywriting headline examples. 		 		I have a very popular copywriting checklist you can download for free at StartFromZero.com/Yes that includes 10 top patterns.

To learn copywriting on a deep level, read the following books: 		 		Breakthrough Advertising by Eugene Schwartz 		Scientific Advertising By John Caples 		My Life In Advertising By David Ogilvy

You learn copywriting by learning the language, learning the patterns, learning the frameworks, and looking at the best examples you can find. My friend Mike over at Swiped put together a resource of all the best sales letters as a bonus for this book at StartFromZero.com/Yes.

I wanted them to grasp the power of being an owner versus an expert. T.V. teaches us to become experts. An expert sets out to learn skills they can use to exchange their time for money. An owner sets out to create or buy assets earning money while they sleep. They think very differently. It can be an uncomfortable transition to make until you realize it’s not.

For now, just think of ownership as this list of criteria. 		 		 		Does the business income depend on my time? (Am I building something I can step away from?) 		Do I have to be the expert for the business to succeed? 		Do I have the key metrics in place I can track to ensure the business is operating well? (25% minimum profit margins if I’ve stepped away, 50% if I’m actively working on it.)

Monk: “Uh...yeah… Hi… So… Hey there... So…” [He pauses and grumbles…feels slightly humiliated…while we all smile and watch. The monk collects his composure and continues.] “I’m working on an idea for yoga studios, but I’m not sure if it’s a good idea or not, so I was wondering if I could run it by you to get your gut reaction?” 		 		Yoga Studio: “Um...yeah… Sure, go ahead.” 		

Monk: “I want to write a little report for yoga studios to solve their greatest challenges and help make them more profitable. Do you think that would be a report you’d ever want to read?” 		 		Yoga Studio: “Oh…uh...yeah… I have a yoga class starting in a moment, but please tell me more. That would be very interesting.”

Monk: “Well, that’s wonderful. I can send you a copy when it’s ready. Do you think you could help with my research and tell me what your top pains are? The things you wish you could just give up or have handled?” 		 		Yoga Studio: “We have problems with… (each studio owner shared a list of similar problems)” 		 		Monk: “Thank you. Would you like me to let you know when the report would be ready?”

Yoga Studio: “Yes, please. Here is my email.” 		 		One thing to note, the studio owner stayed on the call and was late to their own class to hear what the monk had to say. And the other interesting thing is that not one yoga studio rejected us. Not one. I think it’s because the opening line is perfect.

Now, armed with these problems, we must find people who have the answers. The next step is to find the most successful yoga studios in the country and learn how they solve these problems. The way you find the best studios is pretty straightforward—find those who are highly rated with the most positive reviews on Google.




### Excerpt invitation

Subject: Can we feature you? 		 		Hello, your yoga studio looks excellent online, and that’s why we are writing to you. 		 		Would you like to be featured in our upcoming book: Yoga Money: How Studios Maintain Excellent Profits? 		 		We are writing a guide on how yoga studios maintain profitability, and we really liked what you are doing and your online reputation. It looks like you have it together from what we see online. 		 		We were wondering if you’d like to be featured in this upcoming book by sharing what you do to maintain a successful studio? For your participation, we will give the book to you free when it’s ready and promote your studio in the book! 		 		If you’re interested, we just need to conduct a phone interview with you. 		 		We would turn the phone interview into a transcript, then show that to you for verification of course. 		 		Reply back and let us know if you have any questions, and we can chat further, 	


The meta-pattern for being a newbie looks like this: 		 		 		Find an industry. 		Find their biggest challenges. 		Find an expert that knows how to solve it. 		Bring the two together. 		Charge money for value added. 		Give that value for free to the experts providing it.


If I were to talk to a video editor, I’d adapt the five questions… 		 		I’d start by saying… “I’m thinking of building a digital backing track product for video editors. Can I ask you some questions about that?” 		 		 		What’s your current problem, if any, with background music? 		How do you go about getting background music now? 		What happens when you don’t find solid background music? 		If you could wave a magic wand, how would you solve this problem? 		What would you pay for that, if anything?

Then I’d ask them… 		 		 		What are your favorite products as a video editor? 		Where do you visit online to get good information? 		What online video editing communities do you hang out in? 		 		Then once I have his favorite products, I can now target people on Facebook who like those products and advertise my backing track music. I can run ads where he visits online and see about running ads inside the community he visits or talk to other video editors there.

So when I wanted to learn how to sell, I did this for 90 days straight for one hour per day.

To my knowledge, the fastest and best way to acquaint yourself with building the skills for making money is to study the greatest money-making advertising letters of all time.

These letters can be modeled in all kinds of industries if you find the deeper patterns in them. In general, you’d want to read as many ads as possible from John Carleton, Eugene Schwartz, Gary Halbert, or Dan Kennedy.

You can conveniently find the seven sales letters at StartFromZero.com/Yes or on Google. 		 		Day 1: Read “The Wall Street Journal Sales Letter” 		Day 2: Read “Burn Disease Out Of Your Body” by Eugene Schwartz 		Day 3: Read “Do You Have The Courage to Earn $500,000 A Year?” by Eugene Schwartz 		Day 4: Read “Cage Fighter Ad” by John Carleton 		Day 5: Read “They Laughed When I Sat Down at the Piano” by John Caples 		Day 6: Read “Beverly Hills Formula” by Gary Halbert 		Day 7: Read “Million Dollar Smile Ad” by Gary Halbert 		 		Again, I’ve got all of these in PDF form at StartFromZero.com/Yes, but you can also Google them.

The biggest lever you can build for action and results is to get very clear on your commitment and go all in. You can do it gradually by building confidence and reading this book. Be gentle with yourself as you build this kind of confidence. 		 		What does being “all in” look like? Who can we look to as an example? 		 		If you want to see what being all in looks like in terms of the books you'd read, visit StartFromZero.com/Yes for that list.


You don’t have to be big like Elon Musk to be all in. You could have a much smaller desire than “sending a human to Mars” and still be all the way in. When your commitment becomes written by heart, and there is no turning back, you unlock an immense creative power.

For now, just know that being “all in” on your vision is what is needed for your action map to fly.


Do you see the salesman’s purpose here? He has one directive: to match the customer’s desire with the right product. He’s not pushy, he’s not manipulative, he’s not tricky. He’s listening, asking questions, and finding matches. And that, my friends, is why selling can be noble

And one of my top students, Cris Urzua, can teach you how to sell with heart. I have a free interview with Cris at StartFromZero.com/Yes.

You can have competition and still get started

He told me, “I used to believe money was bad and that people who had it were probably greedy. Now, I see money can be a tool for good, and money is the result of value created.”

Dave’s three tips: 		 		 		Optimize for quick learning, not for success. Fail as fast as you can over and over and over again and get really comfortable failing. Make a game of it. You’ll learn so much faster than everyone else and start to have a different relationship with failure that will become a superpower. 		Spot problems and start to build mental frameworks for creating solutions. Probably a year into entrepreneurship, I would just walk down the street and practice spotting problems and fixing them. “That grocery store looks like it’s getting low foot traffic. Here are three ideas I have for how they could increase that.” “This street has so many potholes. Here’s an idea for how to create and monetize a pothole filling company.” 		Start immediately, or before you know it, you’ll have more expenses, a family, and a home, and your willingness to take risks will be much lower. Wherever you are, start right now. It’ll never get easier. 		


Think clearly about what you want your life to look like day-to-day. Find someone who is living that life. Pay them for mentorship. Don’t deviate from their advice. Master a valuable skill that is in demand. 		Make sure your money goals are in sync with your lifestyle goals. “Making a million dollars per year” is a tempting target, but “making $300,000 a year” is wayyyy easier and requires much less work and less stress and is a better fit for me and the life I want to live.

Who’s the customer? 		Service-based female entrepreneurs that want to launch their businesses but don’t know where to even start or how to scale.

Understand your vision, understand your interests, understand your talents, then get to know the market you want to serve. Ask, ask, ask. Listen, listen, listen. (Note: Fabi could have gone with her gut, which was to sell marketing, but her customers wanted personal branding, so she listened.) 		Self-confidence is the biggest issue I see. People don’t take the time to get to know themselves, so they get lost in other personas they follow and admire, and that is where it becomes competition and you feel worthless, like you are never going to make it.

Who’s your customer? 		Yoga teachers, yoga studios, gyms, female entrepreneurs, and health coaches.

Don’t neglect marketing just because you don’t like it. Find other people to do things for you that you don’t like, but never neglect them. Continue improving yourself and learn new hobbies. Get 1% better every day. Remember yesterday was the easy day—now get after it

Know your purpose. Why are you doing what you are doing? If you know that you won’t give up. Next is certainty, trust in yourself and your abilities. Next, make sure you balance consumption and production. It is OK to consume and learn new things,but make sure you are also producing. If all you do is consume, you are just wasting time, and even though it feels good, you are producing nothing. 		It’s up to you. You have to decide. You must be the one who goes to war with yourself


One very interesting thing I find exciting in many of these cases is their book choices before and after their transformations. In Amar’s case, he used to read books like The 4-Hour Workweek and now reads books like Principles by Ray Dalio.

One book promises a result. The other is a commitment to a process. It’s not wrong to like the former; it’s just human nature. You want to get out of your painful situation, so you are drawn to books like The 4-Hour Workweek. Then as you transform and claim your best life, you start becoming concerned with deeper topics that focus on process. A book like Principles will start to resonate. This has been true in each student transformation I’ve encountered.


Amar’s three tips: 		 		 		Document what you are doing from day one to improve on then pass on everything that you did. 		Focus heavily on marketing and sales, as you create the momentum for other things to build later (like a team). 		Just get started; find an idea that’s so good you can recruit a top developer to work on it with you without paying them.

Invest in yourself. “I’d double down on the amount I spent investing in programs to go even faster.” 		You must change your own beliefs. This is the most important thing I’ve learned in my life. 		Learn about limiting beliefs and how to reverse them. 		Know what you want. In life and in business. Write it down and look at it daily. 		Understand a customer’s biggest problem and then solve it. 		Try stuff and fail, then try again. Failure is 100% necessary. Feel fear and act anyway. The number one thing that will get in your way is you. Reverse your limiting beliefs

I wasted 10 years. Find an example of someone who did it and make it work. That was super inspirational. Flip business on its head; start selling before you build anything. And start by asking the right questions.

Be playful and try things. Most of the time, it works, which is strange. I have this ability to suspend belief and try it to see for myself. Don’t build anything until it’s sold. 		I see the biggest thing stopping people is allowing distraction, lacking focus, and the inability to execute. Somehow people can’t make it because they just won’t level up. They do things to prevent the feeling of rejection. They get lost along the way. Some people are just in a loop, and you see them every year, and there is no progress. Stuck in the mud, speeding, and not moving.

Read the book “E-Myth.” Automate what you can, and for what can’t be automated, the solution is creating systems that allow you to have a business instead of a job.

My favorite part was how he had to use a secret cell phone and make his first conference call from a dorm room he shared with 8 other ex-cons.  That entrepreneur was the personification of "Hustle." Nothing stopped him. Not even being put in prison.
