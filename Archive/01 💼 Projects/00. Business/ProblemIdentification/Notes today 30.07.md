Problem Curation

Most entrepreneurs fail before they ever start by picking the wrong problem to solve. The problem is superficial or nobody wants to pay for it or it isn't really a problem.

Those posting to business forums never ask if this problem is so damn urgent, why has everyone been waiting for you to post before they even consider it? Opinions are worthless. You want to know what target customers have actually tried, sunk money into *and done to attempt to solve some problem*.

# Migraine Versus Headache

Headaches are generally a nuisance and ignorable, you might take aspirin or you might just try to ignore a headache *because you're sure it will go away.*  A migraine level problem fixates your attention, you can't eat, sleep or live your life until the pain is gone. Headaches you forget. Migraines you fear ever having again and will pay anything to eliminate.

Another way to say this is people will pay little for prevention and much for cure once they actually experience the pain point.

Experts can tackle a headache level problem with a commodity product targeting weak demand. Newbies always want to go for migraine level problems. Well, I take that back, newbies always want to ice skate uphill.

# It's Your Problem

A recent post tackled the problem the OP had with skateboarders wearing all black going unseen. He seemed to think they'd buy sneakers with reflective soles. Problem was kids don't accidentally wear all black with no safety features. The inventor was trying to solve his own problem with the target market, not what the target customer wanted to buy.

Cool is the problem. And there are many skateboards with cool light effects such a kid might well buy, if the inventor wanted to solve the problem. Most don't. They all have the same problem: Finding some flimsy excuse to shove a product onto the market.

# Scratching Your Own Itch

>If solutions to this problem already existed, and you never found them because you never even so much as did a google search to see how you could fix your problem... then are you ACTUALLY scratching your own itch? Or are you just caught up in the excitement of coming up with a clever solution?  
>  
>Are you ACTUALLY scratching your own itch?

Most say to themselves "If I have this problem, others will too." That is okay, but it's really just a trick to avoid research into market demand and how target customers are dealing with this problem right now. More than likely, an itch level problem may have gone unsolved for years because it is far more mild than even the headache level problem. Make no mistake, scratching your own itch is a market of one and that market reached saturation the moment you launched.

Tech is infamous for slapping Solution on something, because otherwise nobody would ever figure out it solved a single damn thing. Clever. Not smart.

Try to solve your own problem without reinventing the wheel. If you have the problem, seek out the solutions others have come up with and then make your decision. Scratching your own itch only seems like a convenient workaround for shoving out a product, customer be damned.

Take off the blinders. One guy wanted to invent an alarm for valuables, like a laptop. Forget and leave it behind, an alarm sounds. He looked but wasn't motivated to find anything -- so searching was fruitless. In a minute I came up with four because I wasn't blinded by the solution but working from the customer back to the product.

Parents had been using these on wandering children for years. If the execution is everything, he would have done well surveying a few dozen of the existing products and testing against this problem. He was discouraged because he wasn't interested in the problem, and not interested in the customer. He wanted to invent something and needed an excuse.

Solving the right problem can at least double your chances for success.

Blue Ocean Tragedy

There are certain ideas and concepts which are magnets for mischief. Unfortunately the ideas are useful, insightful, but upon release prone to abuse and some really ludicrous mental gymnastics in an attempt to avoid the point.

One example was Reengineering the Corporation. As I recall in a later interview with authors who looked on in horror as a legion of corporate morons used the book title as a code word for mass firings. No reengineering for efficiency or effectiveness required -- but you'd never be able to tell from the memos.

So it is with wantrepreneurs looking for wide open markets supposedly free of competition. Full of very gullible fish who bite on an empty hook. The bastardized ideas which launched a thousand pool toys, rudderless and without sail, upon an unforgiving ocean. No strategy required.

# No Money. No Funding. No Skill. No Clue. ...Nailed It!

As with everything internet, it's where you take good and potentially valuable ideas ... shoot them in the head then bury them in a shallow grave covered with bullshit. In this case, wide open markets are competition free zones unencumbered by mean capitalism and rough realities. Newbies took to Blue Ocean Strategy like pirates on a raid.

Then they made  W. Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne walk the plank.

You are a pioneer engineering a breakthrough product for a lucrative niche. And pioneers get arrows. It takes more skill and experience and money to pioneer a genuine innovation and make it into a market success. Not none. Wantrepreneurs think saying "Blue Ocean Strategy" is like calling a time-out from reality.

The same people like saying stupid shit like ideas are worthless, execution is everything. Then have no brain function about how to effectively execute. And their first appointment to the wreckage they set sail on is first mate: The Early Adopter.

Early adopters are disruptors using something, usually pioneering tech, in radical new ways for big money at high stakes. Your early adopters are not just the first few schmucks that tried your app because they couldn't use a search engine to find something good. First idea people have is these 'fish' are stupid, gullible, and starving -- they'd bite on an empty hook.

That is a nice idea. It even happens to be true on rare occasions. But it's just not something you want to bet on when crossing oceans. Far more useful is the idea of early adopters as satisficers, not maximizers.

Maximizers want best-in-class. Satisficers want good enough. This presents its own problems -- trying to shove out crap thinking satisficers won't notice something is in no way, shape or form *good enough*. Little Tip: Don't Shove Out Crap Using An Unfounded Assumption You'll Find Some Schmuck.

>Founders often hold too tightly onto solutions and too loosely onto problems. The problem, i.e. the market, is the real opportunity. ... At Sequoia, they talk about finding customers who “have their hair on fire”. As a founder, I never took the time to really understand what that meant and I thought it was just an investor marketing saying. Now, when I talk to founders I extend the metaphor to illustrate it more clearly. If your friend was standing next to you and their hair was on fire, that fire would be the only thing they really cared about in this world. It wouldn’t matter if they were hungry, just suffered a bad breakup, or were running late to a meeting—they’d prioritize putting the fire out. If you handed them a hose—the perfect product/solution—they would put the fire out immediately and go on their way. If you handed them a brick they would still grab it and try to hit themselves on the head to put out the fire. You need to find problems so dire that users are willing try half-baked, v1, imperfect solutions.

# Here Be Pirates

Nobody cares if you patent your idea. Patents are like bullets, unrealized potential when you don't have the money to pay for the gun -- a court battle. You sue, expect the company to pull a dozen patents out of their hoard and counter-sue a dozen times over. That's what patent hoards are for.

Yeti is suing Walmart a second time for knockoffs. Amazon is alleged to be copying the best selling products of vendors. The average entrepreneur, with one patent on a meh product with mediocre demand and no market research to speak of has no worries from ripoff artists. No pirate with any self respect wants to be laughed at.

You run a ship brimming with gold, be prepared to be boarded. Your typical dipshit seems to think you planted your little flag, competitors shrug and say "Got here first. It's all yours." Naiveté is not a skill, so don't practice. Ah yes, but what about first mover advantage? Now there's a nice idea to demolish.

>For every example of first-mover advantage there are 10 demonstrating just the opposite. Where’s Atari? Mentadent created the market for peroxide toothpaste. Who? Exactly. Netscape predated Internet Explorer, MySpace was supplanted by Facebook, Yahoo’s search engine has been eclipsed by Google.  
>  
>The Myth of First-Mover Advantage

First movers seem to think your advantage is you get a customer, you own that customer for life. Too many don't so much use any small advantage to learn about the market and customer base as try to pretend customers have no other choice.

>"First mover advantage is a myth," Grant said to the TED audience - and brought the stats to prove it. In a comprehensive business study, 47% of first mover companies would fail in their early years compared to only 8% of so-called "improvers". Great examples include Facebook and Google, dominant startups that came years, if not a decade after their predecessors. "You don't have to be first. You have to be different and better."

>At TED, Wharton Professor Shares 3 Myths About Startup Success

The United States invents LCD technology, Japan commercializes LCD technology. The scroll wheel anyone can point to as an example of Apple's genius? Synaptics invented the scroll wheel. Xerox PARC invents the mouse, the GUI, the desktop paradigm, laser printing, ethernet and ... well, you get the picture.

# The Dead Sea

An alternative explanation is the market is full of the wreckage of fleets of startups that blunder oblivious to the problems a viable business would need solutions for. You see them beneath the waves as your inflatable raft drifts aimlessly past. Another is the false map, leading you to a product niche with no matching market to support it. There is Atlantis. And then there is that mythic realm Juicero -- lost island of vasty treasure. We'll trade in the arrr and yo ho-ho for ...d'oh!

May take months. Could be years. Then, a flash of brilliance "Why isn't there a coffee pod ... for juice!" The never existed idea is born. Kinda. It's easy to see the readily apparent. On oceans you'll want to look out for rocks and obstructions below water's surface because those will rip your hull. Ships run aground thinking it's all fathoms deep.

Tech innovation, real wide open market innovation, requires a lot of funding for success. This grates on the wantrepreneur's nerves, because they know full well you don't need money to start a business. Perhaps, but running out of money is the top reason you'll end a business. Adequate funding, Christopher Columbus.

People have given up, or posted and whined about being depressed upon finding one single other competitor for some supposed "never existed before" idea. That's not Blue Ocean Strategy. That's unwillingness to compete at any level, and it is detestable in entrepreneurs. Wantreprenerus ... meh, who gives a shit about them.

Consumers Aren't Customers

This is an intriguing little concept I have. While there are much more sophisticated concepts like segmentation, let's start with more remedial understanding of who buys your product. 

In retail fashion there is a type of buyer. This person will buy a pricey frock, wear it exactly once, then return it. Not out of dissatisfaction. And not one time. They are regular customers of your return counter, not your business. And if you're not very careful your analytics will show the purchases and not connect the returns; then have you treating this person just like a best customer. Anybody owning exactly one set of your clothes is not a customer. 

Consumers understand the price of everything but the value of nothing. They buy the deal, and if your product happens to come with it, you realize a sale. But consumers don't value your offering, are disloyal to a fault and ready for the next deal. When they give you word-of-mouth, it's about your bargain bin price. 

Customers pay full price all the way up to premium price because they see you as different from the commodity average of the industry. They buy into your brand values, should you decide to have them. And word-of-mouth is about something other than price. Customers will buy from you again and again, they upsell, they cross sell. They are not simply satisfied; that's just acknowledgement of bare minimum competence. Customers are delighted. 

Many companies I have explained this to find it puts a name to their pain. Online, understanding this concept is almost a survival skill. For example, businesses think they are Groupon customers. Groupon is selling deep discounts to their customer: Discount Buyers. With Groupon you are a vendor supplying discounts to Groupon customers. When you can no longer supply a discount, you get replaced by another vendor who can. 

Understand a couple of things. Like attracts like; bottom feeders refer you to ... other bottom feeders. And what they say behind your back is they are smart, took advantage of you, and you are ... not so much smart. That's called a referral. Very few chislers have Bill Gates and Elon Musk on speed dial. What's worse, they're the people going onto Yelp and bitching about you. 

Customers aren't fools. They want value, they expect quality, durability and service.  Customers are not price insensitive, they demand a higher tier of product and service for their dollar. And become enraged the instant they feel they've been taken advantage of. Some of these are influencers and one bad word from them and you'll find yourself closed out of whole communities of potential customers. 

This next part is the kicker. Once you understand the concept you can start to cater and advertise to customers, and deal with consumers -- and maybe for the first time make some money off them. 

**Customer Stratagems** 

First, price doesn't replace thought. The moment you resort to price to lure in buyers, there's blood in the water. Customers are repelled while consumers are attracted like hungry piranha. You can't use price to replace customer insight. You have to know your customer. 

Apparently there's a cognitive impasse about the fairly simple concept of knowing your customer. You don't draw up a demographic profile and POOF, that's your customer. Customers are not the poor schmucks who bought on the one day you weren't slashing prices. 

For the purpose of getting on with it, let's say customers are people who know you -- then buy at full price anyway. 
It's your job to find out why. Then you can legitimately say "I know who my customer is." Why I have to waste so much text explaining simple concepts is beyond me. And yet, here we are. 

Price at industry standard rates, then exceed customer expectations. If you want premium rates, deliver premium service to customers. Because consumers figure you're ripping them off no matter how low you price. 

Bad news is customers don't give two shits about your industry standard craptastic practices. They will be totally unfair and gauge your business against the best few experiences they ever had. Meaning a mechanic is in competition with a five star hotel. An online ecommerce shop is in competition with Nordstrom's offline customer service. And startups are in competition with entrenched competition with full service departments and on site troubleshooting. 

It's a bitch and a half. But you can always put your buying power up against Walmart and Amazon for consumers who will bad mouth you on Yelp. At lowest price. 

Back end loading versus front end loading. That first purchase is the lowest profit, highest effort hurdle. Many have chosen to zero out price, and 'get traction' from anyone and everyone. If you actually got a good proportion of customers for all the consumers you attract from doing that I would be all for it. But you don't. Customers shun you and consumers flock to you. Yet most bonuses are offered to prospects and first sales. Rewarding the one sale consumer. 

That is a testable proposition. Feel free to test that any time you get a notion. Repeatedly if need be. Take as many decades as you like. 

Don't price slash for prospects; level-up best customers. Gamification will really take off ... if a meteor completely wipes out everybody on the planet using the word *gamification.* Point being do not reward the first purchase, reward the strategic threshold purchase. You get an upsell, reward that. You get a cross sell reward that. You get above average repeat buying, reward that.

Reward customers just on the threshold of being a more profitable segment of customer. 

Customers are pissed off that you consider them your property. Reward what you want to see more of: Loyalty. Word-of-Mouth. Lifetime Customer Value. Who do you focus on most? Not best customers, but thresholds between regular customers and best customers, convert the repeat buyer into the regular buyer. Don't spend all your time converting prospects into one-shot buyers. The techniques are out there. 

The Inner Circle. Give customers a good objective worth leveling up for. For example, getting first crack at new products you are considering for the wider audience. In other words, you're yielding some of your control to your best customers who are attuned to and value your core message. 

This would be called brand development if anyone had the slightest concept of what brands are or brand building. 

**Consumer Stratagems**

My focus is on appealing to customers; dealing with consumers. And there are different approaches, repelling and diverting. Essentially consumers you want to put on autopilot and reduce your hands on time to zero. 

The introductory product. If you have a web developer service, you can put out a book. Just don't call it Getting Real. At mid range, you can focus on target customers like project managers with a product like a project planning app. Just don't call it Basecamp. 

Seth Godin has Purple Cow. Point being this is an anti-freemium. You're not getting everyone and anyone -- You Are Filtering Out Bottom Feeders. Put a decent price on it. Deliver value. You're not trying to make a crap business model seem like it's working with the word Free, you're out to monetize from the very beginning. Offer value. Charge accordingly. 

Many companies will charge what's called a *nuisance fee.* A high price to deter consumers who are more trouble than they are worth. Usually nuisance fees just get people looking elsewhere. There's no reason you can't farm consumers and make some money off them. 

Consumers are easy to understand. Customers are difficult to understand. That explains much of the reason everything on the internet focuses on consumers and so much pisses off customers. With new hurdles like GDPR and Sales Tax overhead, we really should start to figure this out. 

tl;dr Stop catering to bottom feeders and pissing off good customers. 'kay.

Overcoming The Monetization Paradox

I usually find if you simply observe what people do, then all the perplexity and tangle of modern jargon simply falls away. This is especially true for *monetization*.

Popular usage is you jettison the entire revenue model and assume you'll snap on something to a project which has attracted penniless freeloaders as a user base. Monetization generally assumes visitor and user and customer can be used interchangeably with little misunderstanding. At some unspecified barely imagined threshold a founder's unproven intuition will be to flip the Monetization switch to the ON position ... PROFIT!

Let me get this straight. You do not plan for monetization. There are no techniques, no methodology prior to 'monetization day.' There is nothing to do in the leadup to monetization except perhaps generate some number abstractly representing warm bodies -- the audience is made up of complete strangers. No metrics, no right number of audience members. You live in denial up until this magic day, then ... You. Just. Monetize.

How about we resolve the paradox by calling it demonitization, and just knock that the hell off.

# Unscrambling The Monetization Egg

>The root of our downfall lies in the way we validated our idea. To grow quickly, we made our MVP free. ... But when launch day rolled around, our “totally sold” leads were nowhere to be found. Everything changed when we asked for their credit card.  
>  
>\-- How To Crash Your Startup

Monetization is an attempt to make money, consciously. Because if it happened accidentally asking how you monetize wouldn't be a frequent question, and miracles wouldn't be necessary for success. Charging nothing *does not* make a great argument you have attracted a viable customer base.

It just means you couldn't even get a book sold and need an adult diaper before you can ask for the sale. You can rake your money into a pile and set it on fire. Everybody who comes running isn't a customer ...prospect ...lead ...bystander ...disinterested passer-by.

Look up the posts of followers. Find their problems ...then post solutions. Identify their lifestyle ...then write about that lifestyle. Stop using social media just like a social firewall.

Stop writing about your code. Start writing about their problems and supply advice to solve it. Then maybe (*maybe*) when you crowbar the word solution into your launch announcement nobody will laugh.

Stop writing about the business you're trying to develop. Write about why anybody but you could possibly care. Your special snowflakiness is showing. Stop that.

# Audience. Visitor. User. Customer. ...whatever

Often when somebody wishes to monetize I ask what they've learned about the market prior to this vague yearning. The most popular answer is to blurt out a stupid number and lamely work the word "audience" into a post. Sometimes with a helpful topic like "small business" and "niche."

A-hem. Small business is a niche with 1,514 SIC classifications. And we're back to assembling the search party to go look for your potential customers. And that crap about you not wanting a billion dollars, as if that was ever an option, but still wanting to monetize above the couch cushion spare change level average for the platform you chose.

Point is nobody wants to advertise on your 'channel' when you do not understand audience makeup, you can't actually develop posts for people you don't know, and your advertising tack-on is not going to bring in satisfying income when you're treating advertisers just like the unknowns 'following' you to god only knows where.

I am beginning to understand audience is what you call people because "hey you" and "people" is difficult to explain when you eventually want money for all you've accomplished.

Every audience member isn't a potential customer -- especially when you've shown no interest in who they are. Every visitor is not a user -- especially when you don't know what 'churn rate' is. Every user is not a customer you haven't yet hugged over the internet -- especially when you deliberately zeroed out price just to lie to yourself.

There is a transition point between Audience, Visitor, User, Customer. Everything you do in your ~~napkin scribble~~ startup venture should plan to master the transition between each stage. Not hope, guess, dream or hallucinate.

You'll notice nobody has to engage with your cash register and in fact we're talking about unfunded, uncommitted, bullshit. At least we know what the click counter mutated into. You can have an audience of a million people who 'friended' you and still have nobody to help you move.

I'll dust this off: Attention, Interest, Desire, Action; and yes it is old. Until Darwin announces an upgrade, this is a nice way to understand what the pretty word engagement means. Social Media experts ...suck it. Too many are engaged in acts of self deception and self destruction.

If you want attention, just do a backflip on TikTok. If you want content which monetizes, demonstrate the way you design clothing keeps keys, electronics, your wallet safely in place ... even if you perform a backflip. People get attention, they just don't know what to do with it.

Your goal -- if you want to use the word engagement -- is to be in constant transition to a higher level of engagement. Your content plan must be getting attention in service to a purpose. Generating interest only to transition to desire. And desire has but one purpose and you are the working part leading desire to take action.

The stages are useful. You must understand the transitions between attention, interest, desire, action make it work. Each stage can either gain you or lose you money.

Will It Blend is a good example of how you get attention. You can view it as entertainment, but in the alternate universe where you meant for stuff to happen -- the series is an ad campaign based on a sales demonstration.

Suppress your gag reflex at the "s" word ...it's what caused this demonetization nightmare fuel in the first place. If you have announced your aim to monetize *you don't get* to act like money grubbing is below your high minded ideals, keyboard monkey.

When most people can't even figure out they could run their own ads for their own stuff, on their own site and won't -- there is not a lot I can do. And even less I expect.

Now see, when you say "Monetization" you get to use the fancy words for just typing up whatever pops into your head.

# [3 Post-Sale Content Marketing Strategies You Need](https://heidicohen.com/post-sale-content-marketing-strategies/)

In most cases the first sale, converting the prospect to a customer, is the least profitable at highest effort. In special cases the social media and content marketing industries might want to stop making out like a one-shot sale is all there is -- more of your clients might survive your horrible advice.

Here's a Wild Idea: Customers

Everybody is 'customer oriented,' meaning if customers are bound and determined to give them money ... they'll take it. That's how you can smear Open For Business so thin it'll fill twenty pages of a website. 

The problem is for most in business customers are no more than a fiction, next-of-kin to a leprechaun or unicorn. So basically customer oriented is a euphemism: for bullshit.

I remember one guy was -- in his own self-admiring opinion -- doing everything right. Yet sales were horrible. He was 'on' Facebook alright ... but in being all social and customer centric and such had never told a living soul where to find his food truck at what time. That's right. He didn't tell his customer *where his moving restaurant would be.* 

Because he liked saying shit about customers he hadn't formed the first idea about. In other words best practices online. Which is why you don't get to talk about gimmicks and nonsense until you at least attempt to sound out the word *customer.*

Here's a wild idea. While you're ideating the living shit out of your product, throw in a few about who's buying. And why you're doing what you're doing. Simon Sinek calls it "start with why." 

I call it finding out calling it "[market]ing" wasn't because dentistry was taken. But that's just me. 

... Everybody has a better product. Nobody is interested in having the customer say so. 

... Everybody is after what a customer is supposed to need. Never what they're willing to buy to prove it.

... Everybody is customer oriented. They just can't understand why the market they never researched has customers who treat the product with equal indifference.  

... Everybody wants to claim this, that, or some other thing. They won't use customer testimonials to make those claims have meaning. "I like X, did a good job" from Harry P. isn't getting the job done.

Many have stumbled onto the concept of a buyer persona or customer avatar. Only to get up, dust themselves off, and go on like it never happened. 

Too many create imaginary friends, not personas. Ventriloquist dummies, not customer avatars. They don't use data. There is no research backing the conjecture about who they'd prefer to buy. These are the people who'd sooner chew off a leg than ask a customer for a testimonial. 

One company made colorant for plastic. Taking a look at their customer base, there was one (single) outlier SIC code. (Industry Class). It was apparel manufacture. Long story short I picked up the thing you talk to customers on, and found out the plastic colorant made a brighter, more color fast, textile for the clothing industry. Today thirty percent of the business is to that outlier industry. So much for big data. 

Customers. Ideas. Seems like a natural. Let's have some.
