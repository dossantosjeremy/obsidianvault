<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>I know you're thinking, Noah must be fearless in the face of rejection. But no, I get scared every single time I face rejection and I get sad when it happens. Every day, I feel this sting of rejection and because of that, I succeed. Just a few months ago, I was trying to hire a designer. I was cold emailing people and this is no joke, six to eight hours a day. This is basically getting rejected all day long. It feels like trapped in a bar where every woman I approach laughs in my face and walks off. One email I got from an amazing designer I was trying to hire was so harsh I wanted to cry. Ha ha ha, you really think I would leave Google for your shitty company? That hurt, and it always will. So how do I get through the fear and the sadness? For one thing, and I do this often, I remind myself I'm going to die eventually and none of this really matters. Seriously. And on top of that, would any of these people come to my funeral? No. Which is a pretty effective way to lessen the impact the rejection has on my emotions. Then I remind myself of rejection goals. Is going to suck. Let me aim to get at least 25 rejections. That alone helps me accept that I will get rejected and turn it more into a game versus a blow to my self worth.</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
The speaker shares their experience of facing rejection daily while trying to hire a designer, spending long hours cold-emailing and receiving harsh responses. They cope by reminding themselves of mortality and insignificance, questioning if the rejectors would attend their funeral. Setting rejection goals and reframing rejection as a game rather than a hit to self-worth helps them endure and perceive rejection as a path to growth, thanks to a learned coping mechanism from their father.

### ‚ú® Summary
Success in business, career, and personal goals necessitates persistence and consistent follow-up. Every achievement such as a fruitful business, strong support network, high sales, motivated employees, and work-life balance requires continuous effort. Persistence turns most 'nos' into 'not nows,' opening doors to opportunities. Following up diligently increases the chances of turning a 'no' into a 'yes,' enabling one to achieve their aspirations and dreams through determination and perseverance.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Everything that signifies a growing, profitable, and fulfilling venture, a supportive network, flourishing sales, engaged employees, a healthy balance of work and play, and so Forth, all requires a willingness to ask over and over again. So let's get started with a few tips. Pro tip. Be persistent. I want you to believe that almost every no you get can eventually become a yes. Persistence will reveal that most nos are actually a not now. My dream when I was in high school was to work at Microsoft. I wanted that more than anything. And so during my junior year at UC Berkeley, I found a recruiter on campus looking for developers. And I said to her, I'm not an engineer, but I'm in business. Is there any type of internship I could do to work at Microsoft for the summer? She said there wasn't, but I followed up with her kept asking. Squeak, squeak, squeak. And after the 12th follow up, she gave in. Actually, we have an internship for business people. I don't know if it was created for me or not, but I like to think it was. It did lead to a fun lunch at Bill Gates' house. A story for another time. Pro tip. Follow up, follow up, follow up. Studies show that if you initially get a no, your follow up ask is twice as likely to get a yes.</blockquote>

### [13:37] Selling is Helping

### ‚ú® Summary
Viewing selling as helping customers by offering valuable products or services makes the process feel like education and a communal gift rather than a selfish desire. Recognizing the value of what you offer makes asking for sales easier and more fulfilling. When you believe in the benefits your product brings, selling becomes a moral obligation to meet genuine needs, turning the sales process into a way of providing assistance and creating mutual value for both parties.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>Pro tip. Selling is helping. If you believe your product or service the lives of your customers, sales is just education. You're helping people out. Reframing selling or asking as helping makes it exciting to offer your consulting or window washing services or provide someone with delicious cookies. Once you accept that truth, asking becomes loads easier and feels much more like a communal gift than a selfish desire. Zig Ziglar said, if you believe your product or service can fulfill a true need, it is your moral obligation to sell it. Dan, that's a good quote. Thank you, Zig. At UC Berkeley, I created a consulting company, HFG Consulting, for local businesses on how they can market to college students. I saw a problem where many freshmen didn't have internships, so they would jump at the chance to work for me, and many local companies were struggling at marketing to college students. We grew to a small army of 20 people doing this consulting. Then one day my intern Kenny suggested we do a student discount card. My first thought was, well, really? That's because there are five clich√© student businesses. Selling student discount cards, credit cards, t -shirts, tutoring, and something with booze.</blockquote>
