With your unique angle, you need to reach an audience, and the best way to do it for free is through social media. You can choose any free platform. Photographers love Instagram to showcase their newest, cool stuff to the Consultants love to stand on a soapbox at LinkedIn. Journalists, marketers, and others like the few hundred characters of Twitter. Designers can show off their work at Dribble. Authors can start a blog for free on WordPress .com. And that's just today. The platforms are going to change. But what won't is how you pick one. You need to know three things to choose. One, which site has the audience you want to connect with. Two, what medium do you enjoy creating content in? Three, what disproportionate results will you get compared to the work you put in?</blockquote>

### ‚ú® Summary
Creating video content on YouTube, although harder than writing a tweet, presents an opportunity for less competition. One can start with minimal resources, like an iPhone, and still build a significant audience. The key is to begin creating content immediately and then transition the audience to an email list for further engagement. A challenge is given to update the bio on a chosen platform with a unique angle pitch to reflect one's identity and value to the target audience.

<blockquote><b>Speaker 1</b><br/><br/>YouTube is simply the best way I have ever seen to grow an audience and an audience of quality for free. The challenge with YouTube is that it's harder to create a video than write a tweet, which discourages most people. However, I see that as an advantage since it means less competition if you're willing to do it. Or maybe you hate being on camera, but that's no excuse either. So many channels have gotten massive like Sunny V2, 2 plus million subscribers to his documentaries about famous people and we've never seen his face. Studio or Hollywood gear, I started my 750,000 plus subscriber channel shirtless in my living room talking about marketing, shooting with my iPhone 12. Nothing fancy needed. No excuses, just get to it. The key principle is to start right now to build your audience and then move them to your email list, which we'll cover in the next chapter. Challenge, update your bio. Choose your one platform and using the unique angle pitch you wrote out before, clean up and rewrite your profile or bio on that platform to reflect who you are and how you help your ideal Customer. Here's my bio. Chief Sumo ad app Sumo. Number 30 at Facebook.</blockquote>

The internet provides the opportunity for individuals to reach a vast audience without requiring permission. Through the Content Circle Framework, one can start by focusing on specific topics to attract a small, dedicated fan base before gradually expanding to reach larger audiences. This strategy was exemplified by Ali Abdaal, a medical student who gained fame on YouTube by creating videos addressing the specific needs of aspiring medical school students. By following this approach, Ali grew his audience to over 4.4 million subscribers and now earns more than $400,000 monthly.

Take Ali Abdaal. In 2017, he was a Cambridge University medical student who thought he'd try his hand at YouTube. His videos included things like tips on studying and memorization for the BMAT.

Later he showed how to prep for the medical school interview, and his audience grew because there was a very specific group of people who were desperate for Ali's expertise on a very Specific problem they faced.
