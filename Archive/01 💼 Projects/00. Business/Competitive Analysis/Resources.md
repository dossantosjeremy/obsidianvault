* Gonna give you a few tools that might help depending on what exactly you need to analyze.
* Crunchbase, Craft, Owler. Analysis of overall information about your competitors (their revenues, rounds of investments, tech stack, number of employees etc). That will help you with understanding where your company is right now in comparison to competitors and how to better position yourself.
* SimilarWeb, Semrush. Those apps will help you to analyze how competitors' are getting customers: their traffic, keywords and all that jazz.
* Moat, Facebook ads. Last but not least. Here you can see what sort of ads your competitors are using. Combining with the previous tool you can also draw conclusions on which channels/ads work and which don't.
