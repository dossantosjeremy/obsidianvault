# Weave Storytelling into your UX Presentations 1

People talk about the power of storytelling all the time. If you can tell a story through your presentation or case study, you will get colleagues to pay attention to you or get the job.

Storytelling is compelling. There’s a reason we love reading stories. They resonate with us, they connect with others, and can make the unrelatable relatable. When you tell a story, people are more inclined to listen, care, trust, and take action.

So when it comes down to user research, storytelling makes perfect sense. But when I tried infusing storytelling into my research process, it failed miserably. I’m a fiction writer, so I assumed storytelling would be inherent in my research presentations. But unfortunately, it wasn't as easy as I anticipated.

How was I meant to take the information I learned and turn it into a story while also being professional? I dove deeper in and did some experimenting.

## How storytelling can help you

Before diving into my experiments (and some successes!) with storytelling, it's critical to understand how storytelling can help you in your user research process.

These are the impacts I have found when I incorporate storytelling into my presentations:

1.  Stakeholders started to get interested in the insights because they could relate to the content better
2.  It generated more ideas and creativity since stories give just enough details for us to use our imagination
3.  We all developed a shared understanding of our users and the issues they were facing—as humans, not just users
4.  Colleagues were motivated to take action when they felt the content was relatable, relevant, and authentic
5.  More people came to shareouts (beyond the product department), so we were able to work on a more holistic and strategic level

"Do you know the woe of our insights being ignored or gathering dust in the corner of a Google Drive folder? Storytelling helps immensely in mitigating that effect. Suddenly colleagues were much more excited about research and what they could *do* based on the insights."

Nikki Anderson-Stanier  
Founder, User Research Academy

Sounds perfect, right? It took me some time to get there, but eventually, I learned some key ways to implement storytelling into my process.

## The Hero's Journey

Getting to the dream state where stakeholders not only listen but are excited about your research is the ultimate goal. So, how do we get there?

**I did a lot of Googling and tried to apply concepts from my fiction writing to my role as a researcher. Many websites bring up The Hero's Journey, a common reference point on how to tell a compelling story. Star Wars is an excellent [example of The Hero's Journey](https://thewritepractice.com/heros-journey-example-star-wars/).**

I loved the thought of using these narrative or storytelling structures in my report, but everything felt like a miss. The "inciting incident" where Luke Skywalker is thrust into action? Well, nothing quite that exciting happened in my research.

Then going into "crisis?" That would be more about how my stakeholders wanted to send a survey when a [1x1 interview](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/tips-master-researcher-participant-interviews) would be much better.

The "climax?" Would this be talking to users or seeing the patterns in the data?

I gave up after terrible attempts at turning my research data into a Star Wars saga. I couldn't draw the parallels in a way that made sense or helped me share data.

So, I went back to the drawing board.

## Infusing storytelling into your research process

These are the steps I took to get to where I use storytelling much more frequently.

### Understand the why and context

First, we need to understand *why* we want to use storytelling in our research presentations. For a while, I didn't even consider this. Instead, I just knew storytelling was essential and something I *should* be using. I didn't think about why I wanted to use it and what it meant in the context of user research.

**I brainstormed the list I shared above: get colleagues to listen, care, trust, and take action. But, what did that mean in the context of user research?**

1.  **Listen**. Colleagues genuinely pay attention and listen to the insights from the data.
2.  **Care.** Stakeholders want to come to shareouts and learn about the insights from particular research projects. They are excited about the presentations.
3.  **Trust**. Colleagues trust me to [choose the best methods](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/how-to-choose-a-methodology) based on what they need and that the data is reliable and valid.
4.  **Take action**. Stakeholders are motivated to act on the insights to fix, improve, or create.

Getting clarity on my goals helped me know what I wanted to accomplish with storytelling. Then, I broke each of these goals into a step.

### Will storytelling work here?

**It's important to note that there isn't always a place for storytelling. Not every report, deliverable, or outcome needs to be a story, and sometimes we don't have time for that.**

**However, if you lack the resources to build out stories, that doesn't mean you can't create a good deliverable or report. If you're feeling stuck, check out my presentation report templates, [one for usability](https://userresearchacademy.ck.page/5cb0c111d7) and another for [generative research](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/1/d/1JQbqYxj1T7vAzj_J-odiKyMUSUW8iJVRGlxp0zJyh1w/copy).**

#### How to get people to listen and care

My first step was understanding how to get people to listen. People listen to what they care about. I then had to ask myself, was I reporting on things that my colleagues cared about? I didn't know the answer to that, but something told me I wasn't.

**So first, I had to figure out what was important to my audience. That meant interviewing stakeholders to understand their goals and needs. Then, I could make sure my reports touched on information they truly needed with this information.**

For example, when I was working on an acquisition team, my colleagues cared a lot about growing the number of new users, increasing app downloads, and reducing CAC (customer acquisition cost). Knowing this is what they wanted to impact, I could capture their attention by talking about it.

**"If I reported directly on how we could influence these metrics, the team cared more about the insights and future projects. They knew they would get information that could help the team achieve goals and also help them achieve individual goals for development talks and promotions."**

Nikki Anderson-Stanier  
Founder, User Research Academy

#### How to get people to trust

Next was understanding how to get people to trust me. This step took longer than the others because I had to deliver reports with the information they cared about.

However, once I put that first step in place of reporting on relevant information, people started to trust that I would bring them actionable insights. They began to feel that my reports were worthwhile.

**Admittedly, it took a few months for this to happen, but I stuck with it. I also started to ask for constant feedback from my audience. I sent out surveys after each presentation or shareout to ask how I could improve the information, style, or deliverable for them.**

My colleagues saw that I was trying to *help them*. Through time, they recognized I was doing my best to create something they needed and included information that brought them closer to their goals. Over time, the mixture of delivering relevant reports and asking for feedback gave colleagues the confidence to trust me.

#### How to get people to take action

I quickly figured out that getting people to *act* on insights was the part most impacted by storytelling.

People act on information that is relatable and compelling. So how do you infuse these concepts into your research presentations?

Relatability fosters a sense of empathy and togetherness. Even if someone hasn't been in the same situation, that person can still *feel for you* and understand your feelings and reactions. Relatability happens daily in informal conversations between friends, family, and colleagues.

**We connect with others by sharing our experiences. But how do we effectively share participants' experiences? [Videos, videos](https://dscout.com/people-nerds/video-prompts), and more videos. Whenever I put together a report, I string together impactful videos for each theme or insight I've uncovered. And then, I play them each twice during the presentation.**

**I also host usability/insight bingo night, where I put insights or usability issues onto a bingo board and put together a lengthy video containing clips from recent research. This approach gets people to pay attention and have fun.**

Another way to cultivate relatability is to have your team try to achieve the same goals as users—roleplay at its finest. I ask teammates to pair up. One person does the tasks users need to do regularly, the other observes, and then they switch. This exercise can demonstrate to the team how painful some features or functions are.

Getting people to relate is the first half. Next, we must turn these pain points or needs that colleagues relate to into something compelling. That is what I find is missing most from insights, that punch or fire.

#### Impactful storytelling examples

**What makes an insight compelling? The consequence. The "who cares?" Sometimes we stop at the surface level. While this isn’t the same as Luke Skywalker’s saga, there is still a way to tell the story to compel your audience to take action.**

##### Story version 1

*5/10 people struggled to find the discount code area in the checkout form.*

This version hints at a problem. If people struggled to find the discount code area, they probably didn't use it. But, I would ask, so what?

##### Story version 2

*5/10 people struggled to find the discount code area in the checkout form. They couldn't apply the code we sent for the jean sale, so they dropped off.*

Version two demonstrates the problem more prominently. The team *should* take action with this version, but I have seen plenty of seemingly obvious problems that gather dust in Google Drive. So then, we need more.

##### Story version 3

*5/10 people struggled to find the jean discount code area in the checkout form. They couldn't apply the code we sent for the jean sale, so they dropped off. The average order value during the jean sale was $50 (with the discount applied). Looking at this population, instead of making $500, we only made $250. We lost 50% of revenue from this issue.*

**Losing 50% of your revenue? If that isn't compelling for teams, I don't know what is. This version packs a punch and lights a fire. As much as you can, if you want people to take action, you need to talk about the consequences.**

Want more concrete examples? Check out [this email course](https://dscout.com/storytelling-email-course), where I give past examples of how I have tackled each step, with even more actionable tips.

Learning this skill was not a linear path for me and took a lot of patience. I had to ask for a lot of feedback on the way, and I encourage you to do the same! Be patient as you try to implement these strategies, and be very open to feedback.

Storytelling isn't something you can do overnight, and you might not see an immediate impact. But, keep working on it, and I promise the shift will come!

Senior Content Marketing Manager

Few skills are more essential to the job of a human insights professional than storytelling. Telling a story about a customer—their pain points, their unique solutions, their background and context— is part of most projects we undertake. Stories are a useful frame or structure for delivering our insights and recommendations.

The problem is that “storytelling” is both overused and under-defined, leading to confusion about what it actually means to “tell” a user’s story or leverage storytelling for our work. We recently chatted with a professional storyteller—[Leyla Farah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ldfarah/)—about how user researchers can better weave this core human information transmitter into their work. 

Leyla led the storytelling team at Salesforce and knows what it means to use a story to create actionable results. These are her recommendations for creating stories that stick.

###### This is a recap from our user research event: YouX. Stream every session [on-demand](https://www.userinterviews.com/youx).

## What is storytelling?

### Story’s impact is diluted without definition.

Like “innovation” or “human-centered,” “story” has many meanings, especially for the business world. Although this variability speaks to the inherent use and application of storytelling within organizations, a tool in a toolkit—like storytelling—works better with an attached process and best practices for use. Without these things, the approach can lose meaning and value, or even can work *against* our goals to gain influence and visibility organizationally. 

Simply saying “we are storytellers for our users” [is not enough](https://medium.com/onebigthought/the-ux-research-reckoning-is-here-c63710ea4084). In order for “storytelling” to remain useful for researchers, we need a definition that helps practitioners understand what makes for a “good” story, when to use it, how to use it, and why. 

**This usually means starting with the goal and audience.**

### Different goals, different stories

**What is the reason for using a story and who is the audience? Is the goal to generate empathy? Persuade? Interrogate assumptions? Each of these goals will require a different *kind* of story.**

> *If we’re using story in a marketing landscape, we are trying to persuade. And that story has a specific kind of structure. That is a different story than one designed to show my leadership that our customers are using our products in a was we didn’t expect them to. That’s a story about a hard truth and accepting change.* ~Leyla Farah

### Know your audience

Similarly, the audience of a story should shape its component parts. An audience might be more persuaded by a deep dive into the characters or heroes of a story, or maybe the conflict or action is where they pay the most attention. Still other audiences might want to learn—in detail— about how a conflict is resolved. Stories will have all of these elements, but the framing, priority, and data used (more on that later) will change.

Thinking about storytelling as we would any other [research method](https://www.userinterviews.com/which-ux-research-methods)—one with best practices and steps for use—turns this from a catch-all phrase into an impactful approach to translating research findings into action.

#### **Three narrative structures to help you create the right story.**

**Just like there are different frameworks for analyzing open-ended data (jobs to be done, personas, grounded theory), there are different ways of approaching a research story.**

**Here are three popular ways to structure a story:**

‍[Pixar Story Spine](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/nathan-baugh_in-1991-improv-teacher-kenn-adams-creates-activity-7102317875926855680-KaGY/)**: Something in the world (of your product, users, etc.) changed, and the way we (the company) are used to doing things no longer works, and we need to discover a new way that will help resolve the tension in the world.**

The Pixar Story Spine ([source](https://www.storyprompt.com/blog/the-story-spine-also-known-as-pixars-story-structure)).

‍[South Park Story Spine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGUNqq3jVLg)**: Two (or more) things are true at the same time, but that contrast one another. Because both things are true, something happened. Because the two, competing things are in tension, the story explores the outputs of that tension.**

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/66c749c022abc4cc8cc048f1_660c1ba555da4d8deede9d9b_southpark.jpeg)

The South Park Story Spine ([source](https://industrialscripts.com/but-and-therefore-rule/)).

‍[Hero’s Journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey)**: Once things were all good in the kingdom (or company, product), something (disruption, opportunity space) requires a hero to go on a quest, making alliances along the way to defeat an enemy or obtain a sacred item to save the kingdom.**

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/59b1667dd2e65000019d07be/66c749c022abc4cc8cc048e8_660c1bd24bb4c17ea586a953_large_reedsy-heros-journey-graphic-1-c26a59.jpeg)

## Use stories to support the broader narrative

**The elements of your story should should work together in service of a larger narrative—one that is encapsulated in a mission statement or a product strategy. No matter the kind of story we tell with user research data, it should allude (or speak directly to) these larger narratives. This connection gives stories relevance, impact, and coherence—especially in organizational context.**

> *The narrative is the overarching idea, the universal truth being told. Our stories should stack underneath the narrative, holding it up. When we tell a story, the narrative should be at the heart of it. Without that, the story doesn’t make sense or resonate in the same way.* ~Leyla Farah

**A narrative could be a company-wide value,  a team-specific strategy element, or even an OKR for a quarter. Connecting a story to these wider narratives imbues it with translatable and understandable action. Your stakeholders should see the reason this story (and its recommendations) is being told and what they should do to apply its lessons and learnings.**

## Stories can affect how AI might impact research

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology is already affecting many aspects of research: changing parts of our workflows or processes, helping new-to-research folks uplevel their skills, and of course creating new exploratory projects as we investigate AI’s role in our product experiences.

And storytelling has also been impacted by the rise in adoption and application of AI.

> *“AI is challenging our notion of what it means to be human, what it means to be conscious, and what it means to be alive.”* ~Leyla Farah

Although this rapid use of AI is real and will change how many of us do our work, it’s important to consider [the stories we tell ourselves](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/telling-story-ai-leyla-farah-4ghjf/?trackingId=iPtcX%2FkHQaug6WNerXpEmA%3D%3D) and others about this change. AI is another tool—like a laptop computer or a shovel—and how we use it is still very much up for debate and determination. Too often, the stories we tell about AI paint that future as already determined…and mostly negative (replacing jobs, reducing quality, scaling biases).

This is decidedly *not* the case, however. Our stories cannot necessarily change the technology itself, but they can shape how it is used and what we believe about that use. 

Insisting that AI is destined to have certain effects might just help ensure those effects come to pass. But what if, instead, our stories describe a future where this technology is *helping* user researchers, designers, and product managers better advance the principles of design thinking and human-centered research? 

There will be competing stories about the future of AI for our work and world. Let’s not doom-say preemptively. Doing so relinquishes control and influence we still very much have.
