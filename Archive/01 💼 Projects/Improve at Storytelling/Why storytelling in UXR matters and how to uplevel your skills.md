*This article was co-written by* [*Karuna Harishanker*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karunaharishanker/) *(Senior UX Researcher at Lyft) and* [*Dylan Trow*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylantrow/) *(Former Staff UX Researcher at Lyft) and represents their shared perspective.*

When we think about strong UX researchers, we often think about their ability to deliver compelling insights at the end of a study that influences their stakeholders.

However, while coaching UX researchers and cross-functional partners on storytelling at Lyft, we realized some people are naturally better at it than others, and that we aren’t really taught how to do it. In our experience, we often find the skill of storytelling is lacking in researchers early in their careers, and in fact, UX researchers of all levels can benefit from sharpening their storytelling skills.

Scanning articles from the UXR community online, we came across limited writing that we felt got to the core of what goes into telling good stories in the world of UX Research. As people passionate about this topic, we reflected on our own practice of storytelling and found that thinking about it within the context of the product development cycle helped us tell more actionable stories, as well as coach others on how to be more effective storytellers. We want to share our thinking with the broader community, and also hear what you think — please comment below!

## What do we really mean by “storytelling”?

We’ve formed a working definition of good storytelling in UX Research — a compelling and simple story that is easy to follow.

*Compelling and simple* means a clear narrative that your team can understand and act upon. *Easy to follow* means sharing your findings in a way that your audience can digest what was learned.

Definition of good storytelling in UX Research

## **Why is “storytelling” important in UXR?**

If we take a step back, storytelling in UX Research is more than just what your final report looks like.

> Being intentional about the story you tell can help: make findings more digestible, actionable, and easy to follow; focus your stakeholders on the key findings; and above all, increase the chances that your stakeholders will act on what you are sharing. Being intentional about the story you craft is important!

However, the reality of getting to that final report can be daunting — we’re often rushed into another study or we’ve been procrastinating on synthesis and have limited time. As a result, researchers can lose sight of what story they want to tell, and more importantly, how to arrive at that story. We want to bring attention back to the story.

## **How do I tell a better story?**

We’ve identified 3 steps to help you tell better stories in your research reports:

![3-step process to telling better stories in UX Research](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*Y8_YjMAH-PIqgBMRtthTMA.png)

3-step process to telling better stories in UX Research

This article was written with a focus on how to find and refine stories within qualitative research reports, but we have found that these three steps can also be applied to quantitative research reports.

*Disclaimer: like many things in the world of Design, storytelling is an iterative process, and you might not ace it your first time. This article is not a formula, it is not a one-size fits all. These are considerations that we hope can help as you communicate a story within your own work.*

To take inspiration from the world of Industrial Design, *form follows function*. We always caution UXRs against starting by opening a new slide deck and adding content, because it makes you too focused on the *form*–your report, versus the *function*–your thesis. Put another way, just like any good researcher starts by identifying learning objectives before choosing a method, we want to first focus on moving from insights to story before starting on a final report.

This is likely the most time-intensive part of the process and is highly dependent on your study. We recommend finding your story by re-centering yourself on two things: **Research intent** (i.e. why did you set out to do this research) and **research actionability** (i.e. what decisions is your research looking to inform). Starting here will help you establish the kind of story your report might arrive at.

## **Research intent**

When starting the process of finding your story, we recommend first grounding yourself in your research intent. Why did your team set out to do this research? Where in the product development process is this research happening–discover, define, refine or launch?

Research intent differs across the product development process and will inform the key elements of your story. Let’s take a look at how this can inform your story.

Research intent across product development cycle and storyline implications

Remember: Finding your story doesn’t begin at report creation. It starts in the planning stages of your study. It’s about having clarity on the learning objectives of the research and how the insights will ladder up to answering those objectives.

## Research actionability

UX Research is rarely done in a vacuum, and is always trying to help gain clarity on a decision. We want to consider what decisions your team is going to make to help determine what’s most important to share (i.e., what insights make up the core of your story).

Some examples:

-   Did your learnings highlight new considerations or questions, the team wasn’t thinking about?
-   Did your learnings confirm or invalidate the team’s hypothesis?
-   Did your learnings give the team a clear signal on what to do next or what not to do?

Leveraging this ‘decision-lens’ is important in Step 1 because it filters out insights that are **relevant vs. interesting.** Too often we find UX researchers putting all the data they collect and insights they’ve uncovered into a report in the pursuit of being thorough. Instead, anchoring on the decisions your team is trying to make can help you hone in on which insights are relevant for your story.

You might wonder, well what about the other ‘interesting’ insights I gathered in a study. Do I just not share that? We recommend documenting these tangential insights in an appendix section, so you don’t lose the learnings while you’re deep in synthesis and so they’re available for when they potentially become relevant in the future.

*Disclaimer: Compelling stories stem from actionable insights and recommendations (the ‘so what’). The more actionable your content (specific and concrete), the stronger the story. This article does not cover tips on crafting strong insights and recommendations and we encourage you to check out other articles on this topic.*

Once you’ve figured out the pieces of your story — central thesis, relevant insights, and what it means for your team — it’s time to thread them together. Remember that your story might not follow the same order as the research questions in your research plan — that’s ok! This is why figuring out how to convey your story becomes important. *How* you share your findings with your team will determine their understanding and ability to act on the insights.

There are two important tools you can lean on when communicating your story: **story arcs** and **frameworks.**

## Story arcs

Generally, a story arc is the path your story takes. A common example in UX Research is an “answers-first” type of arc — starting with an exec summary of top findings and recommendations, then backing up your points with evidence. Story arcs vary, and there are many to choose from, but in general it is important to start with the basics: a beginning, a middle, and an end.

![3 keycomponents of a story arc–beginning, middle, and end.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*-65HcRU9OIzWGqTuiAH3NQ.png)

Key components of story arcs

No matter what story arc you choose, consider including **comparisons** as a key element. Detailing “what is” and “what could be” is a way to easily highlight challenges and opportunities. In early stage research, this might be comparing current-state vs desired future-states, while in later stage research, this might be contrasting potential solutions.

Let’s look at some more specifics about potential comparisons across phases in the product development process.

## Frameworks

Frameworks are a great tool to communicate your thesis. By anchoring your story on a single framework (i.e. journey map, hierarchy of needs, etc.) you can help your audience understand how sections relate to one another, tying the whole thing together. Using a visual representation can make insights easier to understand and recall. They can also help simplify complex concepts and establish relationships between the concepts. Also, they can be a neat way to organize your story.

As with everything, use frameworks in moderation. Multiple frameworks within a report, or incorrect usage often does more harm than good. Similar to our advice above–form follows function. Think about whether a framework adds value to your story or if it’s just a visual way to design the slide. A good check is to ask yourself: “is the purpose of this framework really what I am trying to convey?”.

Here are some examples of frameworks and how we have seen them be effectively used in research reports.

![Table describing different frameworks that can be used in a research report, when to use them, and their advantages.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*SLt1Owv_jgCUw-9TTRmuhQ.png)

Frameworks in UX Research and when to use them

Now that you’re starting to think about how you are going to convey your story, it’s time to fully shift your focus from function (your thesis), to form (your report).

There are many formats you might use to create your final report. Is it a doc? Is it a deck? Is it a video? Is it print-outs lining the design room? The possibilities are endless, and so there is an important decision to be made here: what format should I use for my report?

Part of this decision might come down to how much time you have to create the final report (i.e. which format you feel most comfortable creating) or how well that format supports the story and way you want to visualize it. However, equally, if not more important, is knowing who will be using your research and how they best consume information. Let this dictate the format of the final report.

For this article, we’ll focus on presentation decks, since we’ve seen that as the most common format in our practice.

When trying to make your report easy to follow, we like to focus on three principles: **orient people, leave breadcrumbs,** and **make it scannable.**

## **Orient people**

This is all about situating your audience in the content. The best way to do this is to give people a sense of the contents of your report upfront. Orienting people not only gives them context on what you’ll cover today vs. not, but also makes it easier for them to find information if they revisit your report. Examples: table of contents slide, upfront slides with key takeaways you dive into one by one, or chapters if you intend to cover multiple topics.

## **Leave breadcrumbs**

This helps with wayfinding for your audience, guiding them through each section, and how they fit into the broader story. For this to be effective, it is important to pick one system of bread crumbs, and be consistent throughout the report. Examples: using a framework like journey mapping to dive into each phase or step, icons as markers for different topics, or even colors to distinguish between sections.

## **Make it scannable**

This is about ensuring you’re paying attention to the visual hierarchy of your slides as well as the flow of your content. Ways to test this:

-   **Content hierarchy:** A squint test helps you determine what content is most visible on a slide and if it matches what you want your audience to focus on. If nothing jumps out, you likely have too much content or not enough hierarchy. If the wrong things jump out, reevaluate the hierarchy and layout. Remember, people naturally read top to bottom, left to right.
-   **Slide flow:** To ensure the story flows well from one slide to the next, look at your deck using the grid view feature, and only read the headlines of your slides. This will tell you if the slides are in the right order and if your headlines can be written in a more succinct, or actionable way.

If you’ve made it this far in this article, you may be thinking “this looks like a lot of work!” You’re right. Finding, refining, and presenting your story takes time. It’s something to begin thinking about not just during report creation, but right from the planning stages of your study.

We hope that next time you find yourself working on a research study, you might give this 3-step process a try, to help find your next compelling story.
