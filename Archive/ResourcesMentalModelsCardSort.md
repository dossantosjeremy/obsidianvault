* You will end up with a set of piles containing the cards or terms a participant believes go together in some way. It is often helpful to have the participant give a name to each group, or to combine several groups under a new term they come up with - this is especially useful in determining multi-layered navigation models.
* Depending on the flexibility of the space you are trying to model, you can leave some cards blank and allow the user to add their own terms into the mix. This can be a great way of discovering gaps in your own mental model, but it can also introduce noise into the results.

Cognitive mapping
* Cognitive mapping, according to the Neilsen/Norman Group, is really an umbrella term for all visual representations of mental models. This link from them is a great resource to find out about the different flavors of maps (e.g., cognitive maps, mind maps, concept maps) and what each method is particularly useful for.
* At its core, cognitive mapping involves having a user create a visual representation of the system or area of interest you’re investigating. There are a few variables to consider when designing the mapping activity:

Structure
* The context of your domain can help determine what kind of structure you use in your mapping exercise. For example, if you are focused on a strictly hierarchical space, such as exploring everything that might be under a menu item named ‘settings’, you may want to provide a visual representation that indicates levels of the menu structure. If it is something more abstract, perhaps a blank canvas is all you need.

Relationships
* In card sorting, we only deal with ’nouns’ – the objects or items we operate on. In mapping, we can also introduce ‘verbs’ – or the relationships between nouns. Verbs are typically represented by arrows (with labels) or are differentiated by shape from nouns (circles versus squares, for example). Gathering information about the relationships between objects can be extremely informative for studies aimed at understanding a more complex system, such as data flow through a system or organizational structure.

Vocabulary
* You have the option of providing all the vocabulary to be used in the map, some of it, or none at all. Choosing the right set of words to provide will have a large impact on the outcome of your study. For our settings example, you may choose to have only that word. For a study on how people organize their refrigerators, some basic items or types might be provided. Other cases may demand a larger list of nouns and verbs, like understanding the relationships between different products as data travels through them.

* It’s important to reconcile these variables with the research goals you’re after. A well-designed mapping activity can yield a great deal of insight into the mental models of your user, and can have a large positive impact on product planning and implementation.

Below is the set up we used for a recent mental modeling study using cognitive mapping. We wanted to gather the ways in which customers organized the different kinds of work items they dealt with every day. Because we had specific nouns and verbs in mind, we pre-populated areas of each, but allowed participants to add their own as they needed.

## Goals of performing a usabilty or tree test study
What is a usability study?
* A usability study, or usability testing, employs a test script to ensure a systematic approach for:
    * Testing whether users can carry out scripted tasks successfully
    * Finding what their preferences for completing a task are
    * Uncovering opportunities to improve the product


## What is a testing script?

At the heart of a usability study stands the testing script, or test script, which the moderator follows during test sessions in order to execute task based usability testing and ensure consistency.

A test script:

-   **Helps to make sure you will be covering what you set out to cover.** It helps to ensure that you meet your usability study research objectives and that you come out of the study with the answers you need to make progress on your project.
-   **Keeps you consistent between sessions.** It’s important to make sure you ask the same questions of all of your participants to maintain a rigorous methodology. It also makes your life easier during analysis.
-   **Assists with collaboration.** In particular, it helps others more easily review your work.
-   **Helps you keep time during sessions.** It’s important to keep your research sessions to the promised length.

It is virtually impossible to practice solid usability study research without having a test script. Don’t go in without one.

## How to write your first task based usability testing draft

Use this [Usability Testing Script template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/135OtPVzguF8ZmbtfVL9hqVeehcN48IxWceWr5g070T8/copy) (internal access only) as your starting point for writing a first draft for your usability study:

A usability study script typically follows 4 main parts:

1.  [Introduction](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/writing-usability-testing-script/#introduction)
2.  [Warm-up questions](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/writing-usability-testing-script/#warm-up-questions)
3.  [Tasks](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/writing-usability-testing-script/#tasks)
4.  [Wrap-up questions and closing words](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/writing-usability-testing-script/#wrap-up-questions-and-closing-words)

Here is a bit about each part (you may want to read this while going over the template).

### Introduction

This is where you introduce yourself and other attending members of the team. You also tell the participant of the usability study how the session is going to go and double check that you have their consent for recording and sharing the session.

Use the introduction to build rapport with the participant of the usability study. People are often hesitant, nervous, or even a little standoffish at the beginning of a research session. Simple comments such as “Oh, I’ve been to where you live and I loved it” can go a long way to making people feel comfortable and helping the study to run more smoothly.

Remember to distance yourself from the solution you are testing. Do not present yourself as the person who is involved in creating the concept that’s being tested (even if you were). Emphasize that the participant won’t hurt your feelings regardless of what they say during the testing. Remind them that we are testing the experience and not them. Also remind them that the main purpose of this exercise is to receive their candid feedback.

### Warm-up questions

Warm-up questions are meant to further break the ice, as well as get relevant background information on the participant.

Here are some standard warm up questions to consider:

-   What’s your current role?
-   How long have you been in that role?
-   Do you have experience dealing with \[topic of study\]?
-   Have you ever used GitLab? If so, what for?

**Tip 1**: Even if you don’t have anything you want to ask, have at least 2 quick questions here, as it will help to break the ice and make the participant feel more at ease.

**Tip 2**: Consider asking questions that will help you to understand the participant’s mental model and expectations prior to interacting with your designs (for example, “We have a page called Security Dashboard. What tasks would you expect to be able to accomplish with the help of that page?”).

**Tip 3**: If needed and you have the time for it, you might include some additional interview questions here that would benefit either this study or a different one. (If it’s a different study, make sure it shares the same participant profile with this one!) In particular, consider asking questions that might be used later on as part of a persona or a JTBD study (for example, “What would you say are your top 3 tasks?”).

### Tasks

This is the heart of the usability study script and the part that takes the longest to write. Usability studies usually (but not always) consist of 3–4 tasks.

**How to define good tasks** When sitting down to write your tasks, you should already have [defined your research goals, objectives and hypotheses](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/product/ux/ux-research/defining-goals-objectives-and-hypotheses/). To form good usability tests, start by going over your research objectives that detail what you and your stakeholders want to get out of the study, and consider how to best translate them into user tasks.

You should also have clear, agreed-upon measures to use when determining how a task, experience, or design/prototype performed. You need to define what Pass/Fail looks like, so you can determine when a participant has successfully completed the usability task.

The key thing to remember when moving from objectives to tasks is that **your tasks should reflect realistic user goals**.

For example, perhaps one of your objectives entails finding out whether users can quickly locate a CTA (call to action). But since no user ever goes into a website with the goal of locating a button, your task should never be, “Can you find and click the button?” Rather, it should be about _why_ the participant might want to click the button in the first place (for example, “You want to enable feature X for your project. Can you do that please?”).

Another objective might be identifying potential improvements to the flow. Since real users don’t generally go into websites with the sole purpose of finding faults in it, instead of asking the participant, “Can you please complete the following steps and tell me what we should improve?”, ask them to perform a task that would necessitate them attempting the flow, and observe them carefully to see where they fail, struggle, or hesitate.

**Tip**: Avoid using any words that are in the UI. When a task is written with easily identifiable words in the UI, participants tend to look for those words in the UI to complete the task.

Finally, pay close attention to how you phrase your tasks to avoid bias, leading the participant, and other common pitfalls.

-   It is important to balance clarity and leading words when writing a scenario. The words you use should be words that are familiar to your participants. If you are not sure what those words should be, you should reach out a Researcher for guidance and feedback.
-   If you use words which your participants use and still find they are scanning the interface to complete the task(s), change how you present the task. Start each task by asking the participant to describe the thing you are wanting them to do in the system and walk you through how they would normally do that task. Then you can use the words the participant has just used with you to direct them to do the task.
-   It is imperative to ensure your participant fully understands the task given to them before they begin the task. As the facilitator, you have to balance the questions your participant asks when seeking clarification on the task, with not providing information which could be used to successfully complete the task.
-   A usability study, or usability tests, should be focused on evaluating if the participant can accomplish the task given, not exploring how they might understand the task. If your participant can not proceed during some point of the task, ask them how they would normally proceed and encourage them to try that option.

To learn more about writing good tasks, we highly recommend reading [Write Better Qualitative Usability Tasks: Top 10 Mistakes to Avoid](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/better-usability-tasks/).

**Tip 1**: For each task, add a link in your script for the prototype/webpage that’s relevant for that task. Not only will it help your teammates who will review the script to understand what the task is about, but it will also allow you to quickly resend the relevant link should the participant need it again.

**Tip 2**: Consider noting under each task, in light gray, ‘What we expect them to do’ (for example, “Follow the CI pipeline and go into the SAST job output”) to remind the moderator of the possible paths for completing the task. This will assist the moderator in helping participants to recover, in case they fail a task which is a prerequisite for the following task.

**How to order your tasks**

-   If your tasks can build on top of each other in a sensible way, make sure you order your tasks to reflect that. For example, Task 1 could be around navigating to a certain page and Task 2 around reviewing that page.
-   Cluster together tasks that belong to the same topic or area of the product.
-   As a general rule, start with the tasks that matter most to you. It will take time mastering moderating usability sessions, and it is common to fall behind on time when you’re just starting out. Therefore, start with what matters most to you, and leave what’s merely nice to have to the end of the test.

**How to structure each usability testing scenario**

For each task, consider whether some setup is required to provide context and appropriate motivation for the participant. If so, describe a relevant scenario prior to giving the task. Let’s look at some usability test cases examples:

Scenario: “Let’s say this is a project you’re working on, and you just committed some new code.” Task: “Please test to see whether that code contains any security vulnerabilities.”

Then, consider adding some more specific questions and prompts that the moderator can utilize as the task unfolds, in case the participant doesn’t bring up these topics on his or her own. Examples:

-   What are you seeing on this page?
-   What is this page about?
-   Is SAST running right now?
-   What would you do next, if anything?

### Wrap-up questions and closing words

Here, you can get the participant’s broad impressions about what they saw and experienced. These are some standard questions to consider:

-   What do you think about this process you just went through?
-   How does what you just experienced with GitLab fare in comparison to the tool you normally use?
-   Anything else you’d like to add?

You can also include qualitative survey questions. Make sure to follow up with “Why did you choose that answer?” For example:

1.  Completing the \[insert task\] was easy.
    -   I completely agree
    -   I somewhat agree
    -   I’m neutral
    -   I somewhat disagree
    -   I completely disagree

Conclude the script with thanking your participant and mentioning when they are expected to get their compensation.

## You’ve completed your draft script. Now what?

### 1\. Review your usability study draft

Once your draft is more or less done, give it another read and ask yourself:

-   Does it cover the project’s objectives?
-   Does it make sense timewise? Estimating time will get easier with experience. Keep in mind that usability tests should normally take between 30–45 minutes.

### 2\. Let others review your draft

Edit as needed based on feedback received from your stakeholders/teammates.

### 3\. Test the test

Run a pilot test with a colleague or internal participant to make sure your task instructions are clear and that you’re keeping time. Edit as needed, and notify your stakeholders of any big changes.


https://measuringu.com/tree-testing-ia/

## When would you use a tree test?

Tree testing is sometimes referred to as reverse card sorting since you are finding items instead of placing them into a navigation structure (often called taxonomy).  A tree test is like a usability test on the skeleton of your navigation with the design “skin” removed. It allows you to isolate problems in findability in your taxonomy, groups or labels that are not attributable to issues with design distractions, or helpers.

Tree tests also remove search from the equation as a substantial [portion of users will use search](https://measuringu.com/blog/search-browse.php) while looking for information on a website. While a great search engine and search results page are essential for helping findability, so is navigation. You’ll want to isolate the causes of navigation problems and improve them so that when users browse, they find what they’re looking for.  
Tree tests are ideally run to:

1.  Set a baseline “findability” measure before changing the navigation. This will reveal what items, groups or labels could use improvement (and possibly a new card sort).
2.  Validate a change: Once you’ve made a change, or if you are considering a change in your IA, run the tree test again with the same (or largely the same) items you used in the baseline study. This helps tell you quantitatively if you’ve improved findability, kept it the same, or just introduced new problems.

Finally, we have found that tree testing, while similar to card sorting, does generate different findings. For example, we found that difficulty sorting an item only explained 16% of difficulty finding the item–an overlap but not redundancy.

## How do you select which items to test in a tree test?

If you have a manageable navigation with a few dozen to a hundred items, you can include all of them in the study. For large websites with thousands of items, this can get unwieldy fast. You may find that paring it down to a few hundred items is sufficient if you eliminate some less used paths for the testing.

When it comes to selecting items for testing in the structure, we like to work with items that either cross departments, come from a [top-task study,](https://measuringu.com/blog/five-redesign.php) or are items that had problems in an [open card sort.](https://measuringu.com/blog/card-sorting-ia.php)

## How many participants do you suggest for a tree test?

The sample size question initially comes down to the outcome metric. Because a tree test is basically a mini-usability test, we can use the same metrics in a usability test along with the same procedure to identify sample sizes. In general, the key metric will be whether the user successfully located an item, which is a binary measure like task completion (“found/didn’t find” coded as 1 and 0 respectively).

The table below shows the sample size you will need to achieve 95% confidence around the findability rates. For example, at a sample size of 93, if 50% of the users locate an item, you’ll be 95% confident that between 40% and 60% of all users would find the item given the same tree test. You would need to quadruple your sample size (381) to cut your margin of error in half (5%).

 ![alt text](Notes/Archive/image.png)


## Do you have any strategies for incorporating follow up survey questions with tree tests? How do these help to supplement the tree test results?

We ask participants the [Single Ease Question](https://measuringu.com/blog/seq10.php) (SEQ), which is a standardized measure to assess task difficulty. Because so much of task usability is simply finding the item, we find the percentile ranks offer a good guide as to the usability. An average score is fluctuates between a 4.8 and 5.1 across hundreds of tasks.

We also ask how confident users were and then associate confidence and completion to generate item “disasters.” The graph below shows the four-block for confidence and completion (correctness).  You want as many items in the upper-right as possible.












# UX Research: Testing Information Architecture

In the rapidly evolving field of user experience (UX) design, information architecture (IA) plays a pivotal role in ensuring that digital products are intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly. Information architecture focuses on organizing, structuring, and labeling content in a way that enhances findability and usability. As digital ecosystems become increasingly complex, the need for robust IA becomes more critical, making it essential to test and validate these structures through UX research.

Testing information architecture is a vital component of the UX design process. It involves evaluating how well users can navigate and find information within a digital product. This process is crucial for identifying potential usability issues and ensuring that the IA aligns with user expectations and business goals. Various methods are employed to test IA, including card sorting, tree testing, and usability testing with low-fidelity prototypes.

Card sorting is a generative research method that helps designers understand how users categorize information. It involves participants organizing content into groups that make sense to them, providing insights into user mental models and vocabulary. Tree testing, on the other hand, is an evaluative method that assesses the effectiveness of an existing IA by asking users to find specific information using a simplified version of the site's structure. This method helps identify areas where users struggle to locate content, allowing designers to refine the IA for better usability.

Usability testing, whether moderated or unmoderated, is another critical approach to testing IA. It involves observing real users as they interact with a product to complete specific tasks. This method provides valuable feedback on the user experience, highlighting areas of confusion or frustration that may arise from the IA. By incorporating these insights, designers can make informed decisions to enhance the overall user experience.

The importance of testing information architecture cannot be overstated. It ensures that digital products are not only functional but also delightful to use, ultimately leading to higher user satisfaction and engagement. As UX design continues to evolve, the integration of comprehensive IA testing into the design process will remain a cornerstone of creating successful digital experiences.

For further reading on information architecture and its testing methods, you can explore resources such as [NNG Group's IA Study Guide](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ia-study-guide/) and [UX Mastery's Guide to Testing Information Architecture](https://uxmastery.com/testing-information-architecture/). These resources provide in-depth insights and practical guidance for conducting effective IA testing.

## Understanding Information Architecture in UX

### The Role of Information Architecture in UX Design

Information Architecture (IA) is a critical component of UX design, focusing on the organization and structuring of content to enhance usability and findability. It is the backbone of any digital product, ensuring that users can navigate and locate information efficiently. IA is not just a step in the UX process but a continuous practice that evolves with user needs and technological advancements ([Kickass UX](https://www.kickassux.com/ux-library/what-is-information-architecture)).

### Key Principles of Information Architecture

The principles of Information Architecture are foundational to creating intuitive and user-friendly digital environments. These principles include:

1. **Organization Schemes and Structures**: This involves categorizing information in a way that aligns with user expectations and mental models. Common schemes include hierarchical, sequential, and matrix structures, each serving different user needs and contexts ([The Alien Design](https://www.thealien.design/insights/information-architecture-ux)).

2. **Labeling Systems**: Effective labeling is crucial for clarity and navigation. Labels should be concise, descriptive, and consistent to help users understand and predict the content they will encounter ([Hapy Design](https://hapy.design/journal/information-architecture-in-ux/)).

3. **Navigation Systems**: These systems guide users through the content, providing pathways to explore and discover information. A well-designed navigation system is intuitive and reflects the user's journey through the product ([And Academy](https://www.andacademy.com/resources/blog/ui-ux-design/information-architecture/)).

4. **Search Systems**: Search functionality is essential for users who prefer direct access to information. An effective search system should accommodate various search behaviors and provide relevant results quickly ([The Alien Design](https://www.thealien.design/insights/information-architecture-ux)).

### Best Practices in Information Architecture

Implementing best practices in Information Architecture ensures that the design remains user-centric and adaptable to changing needs. Some of these practices include:

- **User Research and Testing**: Understanding user needs and behaviors through research and testing is vital. Techniques like card sorting and tree testing help designers align the IA with user mental models ([CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/usability-testing-guide/)).

- **Iterative Design and Feedback**: IA should be flexible and open to iteration based on user feedback. Continuous testing and refinement help maintain relevance and usability ([Bounteous](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/08/06/information-architecture-usability-testing/)).

- **Consistency and Standards**: Adhering to design standards and maintaining consistency across the product enhances user familiarity and reduces cognitive load ([Kickass UX](https://www.kickassux.com/ux-library/what-is-information-architecture)).

### Evaluating Information Architecture through Usability Testing

Usability testing is a crucial method for evaluating the effectiveness of Information Architecture. It involves observing users as they interact with the product to identify pain points and areas for improvement. Key methods include:

- **Card Sorting**: This technique helps understand how users categorize information, providing insights into their mental models and preferences. It can be conducted as open or closed card sorting, depending on the level of guidance provided to participants ([CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/usability-testing-guide/)).

- **Tree Testing**: This method evaluates the findability of information within a simplified site structure. Users are tasked with locating specific information, and their success rates and paths are analyzed to identify navigation issues ([LoopPanel](https://www.looppanel.com/blog/14-must-know-usability-testing-methods-to-perfect-your-ux)).

- **5-Second Test**: This quick test assesses users' first impressions of a page's layout and content. It helps determine if the IA effectively communicates the intended message and guides users appropriately ([CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/usability-testing-guide/)).

### The Impact of Information Architecture on User Experience

A well-designed Information Architecture significantly impacts the overall user experience by:

- **Enhancing Usability**: By organizing content logically and intuitively, IA reduces the effort required for users to find information, leading to a more satisfying experience ([UserTesting](https://www.usertesting.com/resources/guides/usability-testing)).

- **Improving Accessibility**: IA plays a role in making digital products accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Clear navigation and labeling systems contribute to a more inclusive design ([Bounteous](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/08/06/information-architecture-usability-testing/)).

- **Supporting User Goals**: Effective IA aligns with user goals and tasks, enabling them to achieve their objectives efficiently. This alignment fosters user engagement and loyalty ([Kickass UX](https://www.kickassux.com/ux-library/what-is-information-architecture)).

In conclusion, Information Architecture is a dynamic and integral part of UX design, requiring continuous attention and adaptation to meet user needs and expectations. By adhering to best practices and leveraging usability testing, designers can create digital environments that are not only functional but also delightful to use.


## Research Methods for Testing Information Architecture

### Card Sorting Techniques

Card sorting is a fundamental method for understanding how users perceive and categorize information. It involves participants organizing topics or features into groups that make sense to them, revealing their mental models and expectations for information structure. There are several variations of card sorting, each with unique applications and benefits:

- **Open Card Sorting**: Participants create their own categories, providing insights into their natural grouping tendencies. This method is particularly useful in the early stages of design to generate ideas for organizing content ([UX Matters](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/06/comparing-user-research-methods-for-information-architecture.php)).

- **Closed Card Sorting**: Participants sort items into predefined categories, which helps validate existing structures and refine labeling systems. This approach is beneficial when testing specific hypotheses about user categorization ([Trymata](https://trymata.com/blog/ux-research-methods/)).

- **Modified-Delphi Card Sorting**: This iterative method involves multiple rounds of sorting, with feedback provided between rounds. It helps achieve consensus among participants and is useful for complex information architectures ([UX Matters](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/06/comparing-user-research-methods-for-information-architecture.php)).

### Tree Testing

Tree testing is a reverse approach to card sorting, focusing on evaluating the findability of information within a proposed navigation structure. Users are tasked with locating specific items in a simplified, text-based version of the site structure, without visual design elements. This method is crucial for identifying navigation issues and ensuring that the information architecture aligns with user expectations ([Konrad](https://www.konrad.com/research/ux-research-methods)).

Tree testing provides quantitative data on success rates and paths taken by users, allowing designers to pinpoint problematic areas in the navigation hierarchy. It is particularly effective in the early stages of design, enabling teams to make informed decisions before investing in high-fidelity prototypes ([UX Matters](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/06/comparing-user-research-methods-for-information-architecture.php)).

### Usability Testing with Low-Fidelity Prototypes

Usability testing with low-fidelity prototypes is an essential step in evaluating how well the information architecture is implemented in an interface design. This method focuses on navigation design and other interface elements that impact findability, rather than content organization and labeling, which should have been addressed in earlier stages ([UX Mastery](https://uxmastery.com/testing-information-architecture/)).

Low-fidelity prototypes allow for quick iterations and adjustments based on user feedback, making them a cost-effective way to test and refine the information architecture. This approach helps ensure that the final design is intuitive and meets user needs, reducing the risk of costly redesigns later in the development process ([Bounteous](https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2019/08/06/information-architecture-usability-testing/)).

### Heuristic Evaluation

Heuristic evaluation is a method where design experts review a user interface to identify usability issues based on established principles. This method is particularly useful when direct usability testing is not feasible, providing a pragmatic review of the information architecture from an expert perspective ([Konrad](https://www.konrad.com/research/ux-research-methods)).

The quality of a heuristic evaluation depends on the experience of the reviewers and their ability to make unbiased judgments. It is often used in conjunction with other methods, such as card sorting and tree testing, to provide a comprehensive assessment of the information architecture ([Maze](https://maze.co/blog/user-centered-design/)).

### Iterative Testing and Evaluation

Iterative testing and evaluation are integral to the user-centered design process, ensuring that the information architecture evolves with user needs and feedback. This approach involves continuous testing and refinement, allowing designers to make data-driven decisions and improve the user experience over time ([Maze](https://maze.co/blog/user-centered-design/)).

By systematically collecting and analyzing user data, teams can identify areas for improvement and apply changes iteratively. This process not only enhances the usability of the information architecture but also aligns it with user expectations and preferences, ultimately leading to a more successful product ([UX Design Institute](https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/blog/ux-design-principles/)).

In summary, testing information architecture requires a combination of methods tailored to the specific needs and goals of the project. By leveraging techniques such as card sorting, tree testing, usability testing with low-fidelity prototypes, heuristic evaluation, and iterative testing, designers can create intuitive and user-friendly digital environments that meet the needs of their users.


## Best Practices for Implementing Information Architecture

### Strategic Planning and Alignment

Implementing effective information architecture (IA) begins with strategic planning and alignment with business goals and user needs. This involves conducting thorough stakeholder interviews and user research to understand the objectives and expectations from both perspectives. Unlike the existing content that focuses on the principles of IA, this section emphasizes the importance of aligning IA with strategic business objectives to ensure that the architecture supports the overall mission and vision of the organization. This alignment helps in prioritizing content and features that are most valuable to users and the business, ensuring that the IA is not only user-centered but also business-driven ([UX Media](https://uxmedia.io/blog/what-is-information-architecture-in-ux/)).

### Content Inventory and Audit

A comprehensive content inventory and audit is a critical step in implementing IA. This process involves cataloging all existing content and evaluating its relevance, accuracy, and effectiveness. The goal is to identify content gaps, redundancies, and opportunities for improvement. This differs from the existing content that discusses content organization schemes, as it focuses on the preparatory work needed to inform those schemes. By understanding the current state of content, designers can make informed decisions about what to keep, update, or remove, ensuring that the IA is built on a solid foundation of high-quality content ([The UX Times Magazine](https://theuxtimesmagazine.medium.com/information-architecture-the-blueprint-of-exceptional-user-experience-design-0460a596eca0)).

### User-Centric Design and Testing

User-centric design is at the heart of effective IA implementation. This involves creating personas and user scenarios to guide the design process, ensuring that the IA meets the needs and expectations of the target audience. While previous sections have covered usability testing methods like card sorting and tree testing, this section highlights the importance of integrating user feedback throughout the design process.

# UX Research: Tree Testing and Open Card Sorting - Everything You Need to Know

In the ever-evolving field of User Experience (UX) research, understanding how users interact with digital products is paramount. Two pivotal methodologies that have emerged to enhance information architecture and navigation are Tree Testing and Open Card Sorting. These techniques are instrumental in deciphering user behavior and expectations, thereby enabling designers to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.

**Tree Testing** is a method used to evaluate the effectiveness of a website or application's information architecture. It involves presenting users with a simplified version of the site's navigational structure, often devoid of visual design elements, to assess how easily they can locate specific information or complete tasks. This approach is particularly valuable for identifying issues in the structure or labeling that might confuse users or slow them down. Tree testing is typically conducted remotely and unmoderated, allowing participants to complete tasks on their own devices. This method provides clear insights into users' mental models and helps prioritize areas for improvement based on usability metrics such as task completion rates and time taken ([source](https://www.looppanel.com/blog/tree-testing-ux), [source](https://fullclarity.co.uk/insights/tree-testing/)).

On the other hand, **Open Card Sorting** is a technique used to understand how users naturally group and label information. Participants are given a set of cards, each representing a piece of content or a site section, and are asked to organize them into categories that make sense to them. This method is particularly useful in the early stages of design, as it provides insights into users' mental models and helps inform the creation of a user-centered information architecture. Open card sorting is exploratory in nature, allowing researchers to uncover unexpected groupings and user preferences, which can then be used to design a navigation system that aligns with how users think about content ([source](https://www.looppanel.com/blog/card-sorting-ux), [source](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/card-sorting-definition/)).

While both methodologies aim to improve the usability of digital products, they serve different purposes and are often used in tandem. Open Card Sorting is typically employed to generate ideas and define the initial information architecture, while Tree Testing is used to validate and refine this structure. By leveraging both methods, UX researchers can ensure that the final design not only meets user expectations but also facilitates seamless navigation and information retrieval ([source](https://maze.co/guides/card-sorting/tree-testing-vs-card-sorting/), [source](https://www.hubble.team/blog/tree-testing-vs-card-sorting)).

In this report, we will delve deeper into the principles, applications, benefits, and best practices of Tree Testing and Open Card Sorting, providing a comprehensive guide for UX professionals seeking to enhance their research toolkit.

Tree Testing: A Comprehensive Guide from Setup to Presentation

Tree testing is a pivotal user experience (UX) research method designed to evaluate the navigational structure of a website or application. This technique is instrumental in identifying areas where users may encounter difficulties in finding information, thereby enhancing the overall user experience. Unlike other UX methods, tree testing focuses solely on the information architecture, devoid of any design elements, allowing researchers to isolate and address navigational challenges effectively.

The process of tree testing involves creating a text-based representation of a site's structure, which participants navigate to complete specific tasks. This method is particularly beneficial in the early stages of product development or during a redesign, as it provides valuable insights into the usability of the proposed information architecture without the need for fully developed prototypes or designs. By simulating real-world navigation scenarios, tree testing helps ensure that users can intuitively find the information they need, thereby reducing confusion and improving user satisfaction.

To conduct a successful tree test, researchers must follow a systematic approach that includes defining clear objectives, building a detailed tree structure, and crafting realistic, goal-oriented tasks for participants. The recruitment of participants should be carefully considered to ensure that the sample accurately represents the target audience. Tree testing can be conducted either in-person or remotely, with each method offering distinct advantages. In-person testing allows for real-time interaction and feedback, while remote testing offers convenience and scalability.

Once the tree test is conducted, the analysis phase involves interpreting both quantitative data, such as success rates and time spent, and qualitative insights gathered from participant feedback. This comprehensive analysis helps identify patterns and trends in user navigation, informing design decisions and recommendations for improving the information architecture. The final step in the tree testing process is the presentation of findings, where researchers craft a compelling narrative that highlights key insights and actionable recommendations. This narrative should be tailored to the needs and expectations of stakeholders, using visualizations and clear communication to effectively convey the value and impact of the tree testing session.

Developing a Clear Understanding of Information Architecture

To effectively set up a tree test, it is crucial to first develop a comprehensive understanding of your application's information architecture. This involves stripping back all visual elements and focusing solely on the hierarchical structure of the information. The goal is to create a "bare bones" tree structure that allows users to navigate through different levels of categories and subcategories. This approach helps simulate real-world navigation and gather insights without the distractions of design elements. Tools like Optimal Workshop's Treejack can facilitate this process by providing a platform for users to interact with the structure remotely. It is essential to ensure that the tree reflects the core navigation paths of your application, such as product categories or service flows, and to test the full depth of the structure for a comprehensive view of its intuitiveness.

Crafting Realistic and Specific Tasks

The tasks assigned to participants during a tree test are pivotal in evaluating the clarity and effectiveness of the site's information architecture. Tasks should be crafted as realistic scenarios that make sense for typical users, focusing on specific parts of the website that need improvement. It is recommended to provide less than ten tasks to prevent participants from memorizing the structure, which could bias the results. Additionally, tasks should not use exact phrases from page names, as this could lead participants to the correct answers too easily. Instead, tasks should challenge participants to navigate the hierarchy logically, ensuring that the structure is intuitive and easy to understand. This approach helps identify areas where users might struggle to find information, allowing for targeted improvements in the information architecture.

Selecting Appropriate Tree Testing Tools

Choosing the right tool for tree testing is essential for obtaining accurate and actionable insights. The tool should align with your test goals and offer detailed analytics to facilitate the analysis of results. Popular options include Optimal Workshop's Treejack, UserZoom, and UXtweak, which provide features for easy setup, execution, and analysis of tree tests. These platforms allow for remote testing, enabling participants to engage with the test on their own devices while tracking performance metrics such as success rates, time taken to complete tasks, and errors made during the process. It is important to select a user-friendly tool that supports the specific requirements of your tree test, ensuring a smooth and efficient testing process.

Conducting a Pilot Test

Before conducting the official tree test session, it is advisable to organize a pilot test to ensure that the test makes sense and works as expected. A pilot test involves running the test with a small portion of participants from your panel to identify any issues or areas for improvement. This step helps mitigate the risk of missing important details, adjust instructions, and refine the wording of tasks. Conducting a pilot test also provides an opportunity to practice with your team and ensure that the structure is properly set up. By bringing new perspectives to the study, pilot tests can reveal what is missing or confusing, allowing for adjustments before the actual session. This preparation step is crucial for obtaining valuable insights and ensuring the success of the tree test.

Defining Metrics and Analyzing Results
Conducting the Tree Test
Recruiting and Selecting Participants

Recruiting the right participants is crucial for the success of a tree test. Unlike qualitative methods, tree testing requires a larger sample size to ensure statistical significance. Aim for at least 20 participants to achieve an 80% confidence level, but ideally, recruit 90 or more to reach a 90% confidence level (UX Planet). Participants should represent the target user demographic to ensure the findings are relevant and actionable. Consider using online platforms like UserTesting or Optimal Workshop to streamline the recruitment process and access a diverse pool of participants.

Designing the Tree Structure

Designing the tree structure involves creating a simplified version of your website or app's information architecture. This structure should be stripped of all visual elements, focusing solely on the hierarchy of categories and subcategories. The goal is to simulate real-world navigation without the influence of design elements, allowing you to assess the clarity and effectiveness of your information architecture (Interaction Design Foundation). Ensure that each layer of the hierarchy is logical and intuitive, using clear and descriptive labels to guide participants through the tree.

Conducting the Test Session

During the test session, participants are asked to complete specific tasks using the tree structure. These tasks should be realistic and relevant to the users' goals, challenging them to navigate the hierarchy logically. It's important to limit the number of tasks to prevent participants from memorizing the structure, which could bias the results (UX Planet). Each task should have a defined correct answer, corresponding to where the information is located within the tree. This setup allows you to measure task success rates and identify areas where users struggle to find information.

Collecting and Analyzing Data

Data collection in tree testing involves capturing both quantitative and qualitative insights. Quantitative data includes metrics such as task success rates, time taken to complete tasks, and the paths most commonly taken by participants. Qualitative data can be gathered through follow-up questions, providing insights into user behavior and preferences (Lyssna). Analyzing this data involves identifying patterns and trends, such as unexpected navigation paths or areas of confusion. These insights can inform design recommendations, such as revising labels or restructuring the information architecture to better align with user expectations.

Addressing Limitations and Challenges

Tree testing, like any research method, has its limitations and challenges. One common issue is the potential for bias if participants become familiar with the tree structure during the test. To mitigate this, limit the number of tasks and ensure they are varied and challenging. Another challenge is ensuring the sample size is large enough to provide statistically significant results. This requires careful planning and recruitment to achieve the desired confidence level (UX Planet). Additionally, technical issues or external factors, such as participants' internet connectivity, can impact the test results. Acknowledging these limitations in your analysis and presentation helps provide context and transparency to stakeholders.

Presenting Findings and Recommendations

Presenting the findings from a tree test involves summarizing key insights and providing actionable recommendations. Use charts, graphs, or tables to visualize the data, highlighting trends and patterns across tasks and participants (LinkedIn). For example, show the average success rate, time, and directness for each task, and compare results by different user segments, such as age or location. Use color coding or icons to indicate which tasks performed well or poorly, and which ones need further investigation or improvement. Additionally, provide a narrative that explains the methodology, limitations, and implications of the findings, tailoring the presentation to the needs and interests of your stakeholders.

Crafting a Compelling Story

To effectively communicate the results of a tree test, craft a compelling story that summarizes the main points and implications. Start with an introduction that explains the goals, methods, and participants of the test session. Present the results and analysis, focusing on the most important and relevant findings. Conclude with actionable recommendations and next steps, persuading stakeholders to adopt your suggestions and make changes to the information architecture (LinkedIn). Use appropriate language, tone, and format to communicate the value and impact of the tree testing session, ensuring that the story resonates with your audience.

Integrating Feedback and Iterating
Analyzing Tree Testing Results

Analyzing the results of a tree test is a critical step in understanding how users interact with the information architecture of a website or application. This process involves examining both quantitative and qualitative data to identify patterns, user behaviors, and areas for improvement. The analysis should be thorough and systematic to ensure that the insights gained are actionable and relevant to the design process.

Quantitative Metrics

Quantitative metrics provide a numerical basis for evaluating the effectiveness of the information architecture. Key metrics include:

Success Rate: This measures the percentage of participants who successfully completed the tasks. A high success rate indicates that the information architecture is intuitive and easy to navigate. Conversely, a low success rate suggests that users are struggling to find the information they need, which may require a redesign of the navigation structure (UX Planet).
Directness: This metric assesses whether participants took a direct path to the correct destination. A high directness score means that users are able to find their way without unnecessary detours, indicating a well-structured hierarchy (Interaction Design Foundation).
Time to Completion: This measures how long it takes participants to complete each task. Shorter times generally indicate a more intuitive structure, while longer times may highlight areas where users are confused or lost (Full Clarity).
Qualitative Insights

While quantitative data provides a broad overview, qualitative insights offer a deeper understanding of user behavior and preferences. These insights can be gathered through follow-up questions or observations during the test. Participants may provide feedback on what they found confusing or which labels were unclear, offering valuable context for the quantitative data (Great Question).

Identifying Patterns and Trends

Analyzing the data involves looking for patterns and trends that can inform design decisions. For example, if a significant number of participants take an unexpected path to complete a task, this may indicate that the current navigation structure does not align with user expectations. Similarly, high rates of backtracking or task abandonment can highlight areas of confusion that need to be addressed (Maze).

Comparing User Segments

To gain a more nuanced understanding of user behavior, it can be helpful to compare results across different user segments, such as age, location, or familiarity with the product. This analysis can reveal whether certain groups are experiencing more difficulty than others, allowing for targeted improvements to the information architecture (Great Question).

Presenting Tree Testing Results

Effectively presenting the results of a tree test is crucial for communicating insights to stakeholders and guiding design decisions. The presentation should be clear, concise, and tailored to the audience's needs.

Visualizing Data

Visual aids such as charts, graphs, and tables can help convey complex data in an easily digestible format. For example, a bar chart might show the success rates for each task, while a heat map could illustrate the paths most commonly taken by participants. These visualizations can highlight key trends and patterns, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the findings (LinkedIn).

Crafting a Narrative

While the previous section on "Crafting a Compelling Story" focused on summarizing the main points and implications, this section will delve into structuring the narrative to engage stakeholders effectively. Begin with a clear introduction that outlines the goals and methods of the tree test. Follow with a detailed analysis of the results, emphasizing the most significant findings. Conclude with actionable recommendations and next steps, persuading stakeholders to implement changes based on the insights gained (LinkedIn).

Tailoring the Presentation

Different stakeholders may have varying interests and priorities, so it's important to tailor the presentation to meet their needs. For example, a technical team might be more interested in the specific metrics and data analysis, while a marketing team might focus on the implications for user engagement and conversion rates. By customizing the presentation, you can ensure that each audience receives the information most relevant to them (Interaction Design Foundation).

Addressing Limitations

While the previous section on "Addressing Limitations and Challenges" discussed potential biases and sample size issues, this section will focus on how to communicate these limitations to stakeholders. Acknowledging the limitations of the tree test in your presentation provides context and transparency, helping stakeholders understand the scope and reliability of the findings. This can include discussing any technical issues encountered during the test or external factors that may have influenced the results (UX Planet).

Integrating Feedback

After presenting the findings, it's important to gather feedback from stakeholders and consider their input for future iterations of the tree structure. This iterative process ensures that the information architecture continues to evolve and improve based on user needs and expectations. By incorporating stakeholder feedback, you can refine the tasks, labels, and hierarchy, creating a more intuitive and effective navigation system (Interaction Design Foundation).

UX Tree Testing Metrics and Statistical Analysis

In the rapidly evolving field of user experience (UX) design, understanding how users navigate through digital interfaces is crucial for creating intuitive and efficient information architectures. Tree testing emerges as a pivotal usability research method that evaluates the findability of items within a website's or application's structure. This method involves presenting users with a text-based representation of the site's hierarchy, often referred to as a "tree," and asking them to locate specific items or complete tasks. By focusing on the structure rather than the design, tree testing provides clear insights into the effectiveness of a site's organization and labeling.

Tree testing is primarily a quantitative research method, offering measurable data on key metrics such as success rates, time-on-task, and navigation paths. These metrics are instrumental in identifying usability issues and areas for refinement. For instance, a high success rate, typically between 70-80%, indicates that users can easily find the correct categories, suggesting an intuitive and accessible information architecture. Conversely, lower success rates highlight areas needing improvement. Additionally, metrics like the first click and directness provide further insights into user behavior, revealing how users initially interact with the navigation structure and whether they can find their way without backtracking.

The statistical analysis of tree testing data allows UX researchers to make data-driven decisions, optimizing navigation structures to align with users' mental models. This process is often iterative, involving multiple rounds of testing and refinement to achieve optimal results. By integrating both quantitative metrics and qualitative feedback, researchers can gain a comprehensive understanding of user navigation patterns and the underlying reasons for any difficulties encountered.

Several tools facilitate tree testing, each offering unique features to enhance the research process. Platforms like UXtweak and Optimal Workshop's Treejack provide robust analytics capabilities, enabling researchers to import data, create custom tasks, and analyze findings with precision. These tools often include visualization techniques that simplify data interpretation and sharing, making it easier to communicate insights to stakeholders.

Task Success Rate

Task success rate is a fundamental metric in tree testing, providing insights into how effectively users can navigate through a website's information architecture to complete specific tasks. This metric is typically expressed as a percentage, representing the proportion of users who successfully reach the correct endpoint in the tree structure. A high success rate indicates that the information architecture aligns well with user expectations, while a low success rate suggests potential issues in the structure or labeling of the navigation paths.

In practice, a success rate of 80% or higher is generally considered satisfactory, indicating that the majority of users can find the information they need without significant difficulty. However, the acceptable threshold may vary depending on the complexity of the website and the nature of the tasks. For instance, a more complex site might have a lower acceptable success rate due to the inherent challenges in navigating intricate structures. (NNG Group)

Time on Task

Time on task measures the duration users take to complete a task within the tree test. This metric provides insights into the efficiency of the information architecture. A shorter time on task generally indicates a more intuitive and user-friendly structure, as users can quickly locate the information they need. Conversely, longer times may suggest confusion or difficulty in navigating the tree, potentially highlighting areas for improvement.

Analyzing time on task involves comparing the average time taken by users to complete each task. Significant deviations from the average can indicate specific tasks or sections of the tree that require attention. For example, if users consistently take longer to complete a particular task, it may be necessary to reevaluate the labeling or organization of that section. (NNG Group)

Directness

Directness is a metric that evaluates the path users take to complete a task in a tree test. It measures how closely the user's path aligns with the optimal path predefined by the test designers. A high directness score indicates that users are following the expected path, suggesting that the information architecture is intuitive and aligns with user expectations.

To calculate directness, researchers compare the user's path to the optimal path and assign a score based on the number of deviations. A directness score of 1.0 means the user followed the optimal path exactly, while lower scores indicate more deviations. This metric is particularly useful for identifying areas where users may be taking unnecessary detours, which can inform adjustments to improve navigation efficiency. (NNG Group)

First Click Analysis

First click analysis focuses on the initial choice users make when presented with a task in a tree test. This metric is crucial because research has shown that the first click is a strong predictor of task success. If users make the correct first click, they are significantly more likely to complete the task successfully.

Analyzing first click data involves examining the percentage of users who make the correct initial choice for each task. A high percentage indicates that the information architecture is intuitive and that users can easily identify the correct starting point. Conversely, a low percentage may suggest that the initial options are unclear or misleading, necessitating a reevaluation of the labeling or organization of the initial choices. (NNG Group)

Path-Specific Measures

Path-specific measures provide detailed insights into the specific routes users take within the tree structure. These metrics can include the number of clicks, the sequence of choices, and the frequency of backtracking. By analyzing these measures, researchers can identify patterns in user behavior and pinpoint specific areas of the tree that may be causing confusion or difficulty.

For example, a high frequency of backtracking may indicate that users are unsure of their choices and are retracing their steps to find the correct path. Similarly, a high number of clicks may suggest that users are taking longer routes to reach their destination, potentially highlighting areas where the information architecture can be streamlined. By examining these path-specific measures, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of user behavior and make targeted improvements to the information architecture. (NNG Group)

Statistical Analysis in Tree Testing
Analyzing User Navigation Patterns

Tree testing provides a wealth of data that can be analyzed to understand user navigation patterns. Unlike the existing content that focuses on metrics like task success rate and time on task, this section delves into the statistical methods used to interpret navigation patterns. By examining the sequence of user actions, researchers can apply statistical models to identify common paths and deviations. Techniques such as Markov chain analysis can be employed to model the probability of users transitioning from one node to another within the tree structure. This approach helps in understanding the likelihood of users following certain paths and can highlight potential bottlenecks or areas of confusion in the navigation structure (Interaction Design Foundation).

Statistical Significance in Tree Testing

While previous sections have discussed metrics like directness and path-specific measures, this section focuses on the statistical significance of tree testing results. Determining whether observed differences in user behavior are statistically significant is crucial for making informed design decisions. Statistical tests such as chi-square tests can be used to compare the distribution of user paths against expected distributions. This helps in identifying whether certain navigation paths are significantly more or less popular than others, providing insights into the effectiveness of the information architecture (Optimal Workshop).

Correlation Analysis of Tree Testing Metrics

Correlation analysis can be used to explore relationships between different tree testing metrics. For instance, researchers can examine the correlation between task success rates and time on task to understand if quicker task completion is associated with higher success rates. This analysis can reveal whether certain aspects of the navigation structure are consistently problematic across different metrics. By identifying strong correlations, UX designers can prioritize areas for improvement that are likely to have the greatest impact on overall user experience (UserTesting).

Predictive Modeling for User Behavior

Predictive modeling techniques can be applied to tree testing data to forecast user behavior. Machine learning algorithms, such as decision trees or logistic regression, can be used to predict the likelihood of users successfully completing tasks based on their navigation patterns. This approach allows researchers to simulate potential changes to the information architecture and assess their impact on user behavior before implementing them. By leveraging predictive models, UX teams can make data-driven decisions to optimize navigation structures (UXtweak).

Bayesian Analysis in Tree Testing

Bayesian analysis offers a robust framework for interpreting tree testing data, particularly in situations where sample sizes are small or data is sparse. Unlike traditional frequentist approaches, Bayesian methods incorporate prior knowledge and update beliefs based on observed data. This can be particularly useful in tree testing, where prior insights from card sorting or previous tests can inform the analysis. Bayesian models can provide probability distributions for various outcomes, offering a nuanced understanding of user behavior and the uncertainty associated with different navigation paths (Lyssna).

Multivariate Analysis of Tree Testing Data

Multivariate analysis techniques, such as principal component analysis (PCA) or cluster analysis, can be employed to explore complex relationships within tree testing data. These methods allow researchers to reduce the dimensionality of the data and identify underlying patterns that may not be apparent through univariate analysis. For example, PCA can help in identifying key factors that contribute to successful navigation, while cluster analysis can group users with similar navigation behaviors, providing insights into different user personas and their interaction with the site structure (Clay Global).

Longitudinal Analysis of Tree Testing Results

Longitudinal analysis involves examining tree testing data over time to identify trends and changes in user behavior. This approach is particularly useful for iterative design processes, where multiple rounds of testing are conducted. By analyzing changes in metrics such as task success rate and time on task across different iterations, researchers can assess the impact of design modifications and track improvements in the information architecture. Longitudinal analysis provides a comprehensive view of how user experience evolves, enabling continuous optimization of the navigation structure (Full Clarity).

Statistical Power and Sample Size Considerations

Determining the appropriate sample size for tree testing is critical to ensure the reliability of the results. Statistical power analysis can be used to calculate the minimum sample size required to detect significant effects with a given level of confidence. This involves considering factors such as the expected effect size, the desired level of statistical significance, and the power of the test. By ensuring adequate sample sizes, researchers can minimize the risk of Type I and Type II errors, leading to more robust conclusions about the effectiveness of the information architecture (LoopPanel).

Advanced Statistical Techniques for Tree Testing
Crafting Realistic Tasks for Tree Testing

Creating realistic tasks is a cornerstone of effective tree testing. Unlike the existing content that focuses on metrics like task success rate and time on task, this section emphasizes the importance of task realism in capturing authentic user behavior. Tasks should mimic real-world scenarios that users are likely to encounter on the website or application. This approach ensures that the insights gained from the tree test are applicable to actual user experiences. For instance, if a website is an e-commerce platform, tasks might include finding a specific product category or locating customer service information. Crafting tasks that reflect genuine user goals helps in identifying navigation issues that users might face in real-world interactions (Great Question).

Selecting the Right Participants

Selecting participants who closely match the target audience is crucial for obtaining relevant and actionable insights. This section expands on the existing content by focusing on the recruitment process and the importance of demographic alignment. A representative sample ensures that the findings are applicable to the broader user base. For example, if the website targets young adults, the participant pool should reflect this demographic. Additionally, using screener surveys can help filter out unsuitable candidates, ensuring that the final participant list is both relevant and engaged. This careful selection process enhances the reliability of the tree testing results (Great Question).

Avoiding Leading Questions

Avoiding leading questions is essential to maintain the integrity of the tree testing process. This section builds on the existing content by highlighting the impact of question phrasing on participant responses. Leading questions can inadvertently guide participants toward specific answers, skewing the results and reducing the validity of the insights. To prevent this, tasks and questions should be neutrally worded, allowing participants to navigate the tree structure based on their understanding rather than external cues. This approach ensures that the data collected reflects genuine user behavior and provides a true representation of the navigation challenges users face (Great Question).

Limiting Task Quantity

Limiting the number of tasks in a tree testing session is important to prevent participant fatigue and ensure authentic responses. This section complements the existing content by focusing on the balance between task quantity and participant engagement. Overburdening participants with too many tasks can lead to fatigue, resulting in rushed or inauthentic responses. It is generally recommended to have no more than 10-15 tasks per session. This limitation helps maintain participant focus and ensures that the data collected is reliable and reflective of genuine user interactions. By carefully selecting a manageable number of tasks, researchers can obtain high-quality insights without overwhelming participants (Great Question).
