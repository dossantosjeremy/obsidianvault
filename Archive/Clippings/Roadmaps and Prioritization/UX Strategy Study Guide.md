## UX Strategy: Overview

A **UX strategy** is a plan of actions designed to reach an improved future state of the organization’s user experience over an established period of time.

There are 3 primary components that make up a UX strategy:   

1.  **Vision** or statement(s) of intent
2.  **Goals** and measures
3.  **Plan**

*A UX strategy is comprised of a vision (the improved state you’re aiming for), goals (how you know if you’re making progress), and a plan (the path you’ll take to get there).*

If you’re new to thinking about UX strategy, start here:

## Vision

In order to craft a plan for how to get somewhere, you first have to know where you’re going and why. Think of your **vision** as the summary of your product or service in its ideal form and of the value it provides. It must be strategically positioned — meaning research-based and viable in the market.
