We as product managers need to be learning all the time. We need to stay up to date with our industry, competitors, and technologies. We must always be working to get better at our jobs and deliver more impact for our users. 

Fortunately (or unfortunately) there is no dearth of product management resources available on the internet. With so much variety, it becomes very difficult to separate the signal from the noise. And with the limited amount of time we have, we should only focus on the best of the best resources.

In this article, I share the absolute best resources that I have collected over the last 3+ years or so. Every resource on the list has stood the test of time and I can guarantee that it is the best quality content on the topic.

I update this list every time I discover a new resource (that passes all my tests.) Don’t forget to bookmark it for future reference.

Reddit has product managers from all stages of their careers, which makes this subreddit very unique. On it, I've found posts by younger PMs where I've been able to share my learnings and help others with the knowledge I have. And on it, I've also found posts by senior product leaders which have taught me a lot and made me a great product manager. I recommend visiting this subreddit at least once a week, and reading the top 5-7 posts.
