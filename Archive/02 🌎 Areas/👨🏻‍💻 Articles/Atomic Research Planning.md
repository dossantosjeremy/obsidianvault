# Atomic Research nuggets

# The process
1. You need to have the global vision of the atom first. 
2. You then need to divide it into its constituents parts = the research objectives. 
3. You then need to divide it into several research questions 
4. Each research question is associated to several user interview questions
5. You check back the all of the questions you ask are associated to a research question
6. You check that all research questions are addressed
7. You check that all the objectives are addressed
