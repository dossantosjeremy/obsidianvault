* The research review is the first and best place to begin any research for products by starting with what we already have.
* Invest a few hours to gather and summarize existing material and enjoy these benefits: 
Share current product knowledge across the team.

    * Be primed for the Knowns Unknowns Assumptions (KUAs) activity to come.
    * Remind ourselves of some knowledge we may have forgotten.
    * Get all members of the product team (designers, engineers, product managers, researchers, writers) on common ground. 

* Use a template. 
* Timebox this effort. 
    * Step 1: Review research summaries. 
    * Step 2: Identify key insights from the research. 
    * Step 3: Summarize answers to key questions. 

* This research review will be the foundation for the remaining research activities.
* And, it's a great inventory of what your team knows about the topic.
* As a team, consider a refresh once or twice a year.
* And be sure to introduce new team members to the research review to help them get up-to-speed quickly. 

* Use this research review page as a base where you can store and link to all of the research.
* And, since research never ends (you'll want to refresh over time), your research review is one central source of truth.

Summary:  Secondary research is an essential foundation for UX work, necessary to explore the problem space and scope of prior projects and to identify important questions and best practices in the field of study. It also helps to focus the scope of your own project and often saves money.

- Use case: Have you ever completed a project only to find out that something very similar has already been done in your organization a couple of years ago? That situation is common, especially with rising employee-churn rates, and fueled the popularity of research repositories (e.g., Microsoft Human Insights System)
- Secondary research use case: **Secondary research,** also known as desk research or, in academic contexts, literature review, refers to the act of gathering prior research findings and other relevant information related to a new project. It is a foundational part of any emerging research project and provides the project with background and context. Secondary research allows us to stand on the shoulders of giants and not to reinvent the wheel every time we initiate a new program or plan a study.
- What to gain from it: a way to minimize research costs, win internal stakeholders and get scaffolding for your own projects.
- Academic publications include a literature review at the beginning to showcase context or known gaps and to justify the motivation for the research questions.
- Secondary research should be a standard first step in any rigorous research practice, but it’s also often cost-effective in more casual settings.
- it is always good to start with a broad overview of the field and existent resources.
- Secondary research shows which topics are particularly popular or important for your organization and what problems other researchers are trying to solve.
- Types of Secondary Research
- Secondary research can be divided into two main types: **internal** and **external research.**
- **Internal secondary research** involves gathering all relevant research findings already available in your organization. These might include artifacts from the past primary research projects, maps (e.g., [customer-journey map](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/customer-journey-mapping/), [service blueprint](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/service-blueprints-definition/)), deliverables from external consultants, or results from different kinds of [workshops](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/5-ux-workshops/) (e.g., discovery, design thinking, etc.). Hopefully, these will be available in a [research repository](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/research-repositories/). 
- **External secondary research** is focused on sources outside of your organization, such as academic journals, public libraries, open data repositories, internet searches, and white papers published by reputable organizations. For example, external resources for the field of human-computer interaction (HCI) can be found at the [Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) digital library](https://dl.acm.org/), [Journal of Usability Studies (JUS](https://uxpajournal.org/)), or research websites like [ours](https://www.nngroup.com/). University libraries and labs like [UCSD Geisel Library](https://ucsd.libguides.com/az.php), [Carnegie Mellon University Libraries](https://guides.library.cmu.edu/cfadesign), [MIT D-Lab](https://d-lab.mit.edu/resources/publications), [Stanford d.school](https://dschool.stanford.edu/resources), and specialized portals like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) offer another avenue for directed search. 
- **Choose the topic of research & write a** [**problem statement**](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/problem-statements/)**.** 
- Write a concise description of the problem to be solved. For example, if you are doing a website redesign, you might want to both learn the current standards and look at all the previous design iterations to avoid issues that your team already identified.
- **Identi****fy external and internal resources.**
- Peer-reviewed publications (such as those published in academic journals and conferences) are a fairly reliable source. They always include a section describing methods, data-collection techniques, and study limitations. If a study you plan to use does not include such information, that might be a red flag and a reason to further scrutinize that source. Public datasets also often present some challenges because of errors and inclusion criteria, especially if they were collected for another purpose. 
- One should be cautious of the seemingly reputable “research” findings published across different websites in a form of blog posts, which could be opinion pieces, not backed up by primary research. If you encounter such a piece, ask yourself — is the conclusion of the writeup based on a real study? If the study was quantitative, was it properly analyzed (e.g., at the very least, are [confidence intervals](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/confidence-interval/) reported, and was [statistical significance](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/understanding-statistical-significance/) evaluated?). For all studies, was the method sound and nonbiased (e.g., did the study have [internal and external validity](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/internal-vs-external-validity/))?
- A more nuanced challenge involves evaluating findings based on a different audience, which might not be always generalizable to your situation, but may form hypotheses worthy of investigating. For example, if a design pattern is found okay to use by young adults, you may still want to know if this finding will also be valid for older generations.
- **Collect and analyze data from external and internal resources.**
- Remember that secondary research involves both the existing data and existing research. Both of those categories become helpful resources when they are critically evaluated for any inherent biases, omissions, and limitations. If you already have some secondary data in your organization, such as customer service logs or search logs, you should include them in secondary research alongside any existent analysis of such logs and previous reports. It is helpful to revisit previous findings, compare how they have or have not been implemented to refresh institutional memory and support future research initiatives.
- **Refine your problem statement and determine what still needs to be investigated.**
- Once you collected the relevant information, write a summary of findings, and discuss them with your team. You might need to refine your problem statement to determine what information you still need to answer your research questions. Next time your team is planning to adopt a trendy new design pattern, it may be a good idea to go back and search the web or an academic database for any evaluations of that pattern.
- It is important to note that secondary research is not a substitute for primary research. It is always better to do both. Although secondary research is often cost-effective and quick, its quality depends to a large extent on the quality of your sources. Therefore, before using any secondary sources, you need to identify their validity and limitations.

- Secondary or desk research  
    is a synthesis of existing and available information  
    on a topic.  
    It often includes research available from the internet,  
    government agencies, libraries, educational institutions,  
    or a summary of previous primary research efforts.  
    Imagine that you are starting an exciting new project  
    and you haven't had the opportunity  
    to do your own research yet.  
    You can start at your desk  
    and incorporate available secondary resources  
    from the inside and outside of your organization  
    to gain a broader understanding of the subject matter.  
    Step one: check your company's research repository  
    to see what existing research is available.  
    This is a great opportunity  
    to get in touch with the research ops  
    if you have them in your organization.  
    If not, topic librarians are always there  
    to help the general public.  
    Library websites usually post  
    their contact information online  
    so you can get in touch through chat or email.  
    Also, please don't shy away from the academic research.  
    Many studies are available for free  
    or your organization might have a subscription  
    to reports published by reputable journals in your field.  
    Step two, look at external research or case studies  
    published by competitors or other industry leaders.  
    There are several paid databases and market reports,  
    as well as a large of white papers and articles  
    published by government agencies  
    and nonprofit organizations that might be helpful.  
    You can also find guidelines and recommendations  
    from reports written by companies dedicated to research,  
    such as the ones we publish at Nielsen Norman Group.  
    Step three, general online search.  
    It's definitely worth doing a quick search  
    for all main keywords to see what comes up.  
    Aa general internet search might seem like  
    the easiest thing to do,  
    yet it might also be tricky  
    not to get into a rabbit hole of low-quality,  
    repetitive content.  
    To avoid that, check the author, their affiliation,  
    and verify original sources.  
    When you find relevant information,  
    it is good practice to keep it in a living document  
    or repository with collections of resources  
    on a specific topic.  
    It might require some patience,  
    but who knows what you can find.  
    Don't underestimate the power of secondary research,  
    as it is the central foundation for your own studies.
