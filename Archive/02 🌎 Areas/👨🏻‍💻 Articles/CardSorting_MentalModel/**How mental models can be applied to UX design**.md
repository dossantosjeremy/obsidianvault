## **How mental models can be applied to UX design**

Let’s begin our journey by understanding **Gestalt principles of perceptual organization**. This is a school of thought that allows us to see the way that people structure the environment and perceive it.

### **Principle of proximity**

If you look at the image below, you can see how in the first group of dots we perceive them to be in the same entity. But in the second set of dots, we perceive them to be two separate entities because of the small gap.

In the webform below you can see the principle of proximity at work in a negative way. Each cell looks like a separate entity, when in fact they’re all related.

For a positive example of the principle of proximity, look at the following webform from Github…

You can see how the red blocks make the three separate entities clear. The three text-entry fields form one entity, the headline and introductory text is another entity, and the third is the sign-in [CTA](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/11-characteristics-of-persuasive-call-to-action-buttons).

Our own brains have created these rules, and if you’re a designer, it’s important to know how this placement affects usability.

### **Principle of similarity**

When shapes or colors appear similar to each other, we group them together. Not only that, we assume that these similar things have the same functions. For example, in the image below the squares are all separate from each other. However, when we look at the image we mentally group the squares with the same colors.

In applying this idea to UX design we can look at hyperlinks. We understand that anything formed of blue text is a hyperlink and and assume its function is to open a new browser tab. The same thing occurs with the green CTAs in the image below.

### **Principle of common region**

If you separate the elements so they form a group we can perceive each group as being a separate entity.

Take Pinterest as an example, where although any given pin’s image and text are clearly different elements, thanks to the dividing lines we know that they belong to the same entity.

### **Principle of continuity**

This is one of the most important and common principles. In the image below you can see this at work. Although the intention of the lines is to follow the color structure, our brain prioritizes following the form of the lines. Structure is more visually significant than color.

In Netflix you can see this applied, with the slider function that lets you cycle sideways through the listings.

### **Principle of closure**

Where elements have a specific distance between them, they generate a shape that our brains translate into a solid form. Check out the zebra below…

Or the IBM and Adidas logos…

### **Principle of focal point**

When just one of the elements has a different shape or color, our brain prioritizes this distinguished element over the others.

This can be used to make specific CTAs you want to drive people towards, i.e. log-in or sign-up buttons. It can help guide the viewers eyes to what you want them to see first.
