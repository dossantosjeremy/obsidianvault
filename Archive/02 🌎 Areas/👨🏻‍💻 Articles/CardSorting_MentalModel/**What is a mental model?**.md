## **What is a mental model?**

Mental models derive from the way humans perceive the world around them. They are developed from observation, perception, immersive experience and, most importantly, culture. Mental models are beliefs based on [cognition](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/psychology-of-ux-design), rather than facts.

For example:

*If I ride my bicycle really fast, then hit the front brake, I know that I will fly over the handle-bars because of my personal experience, observation of others, and knowledge of the way the brakes work. This is my mental model of this particular system.*

Within UX, **mental models can allow developers to understand and analyze problems in an interactive design**. The reason that people make mistakes when interacting with​ ​a product is often because their mental model is different to the developer’s mental model.

Since all people perceive the world in an individual way, all users generate individual mental models. The​ ​challenge here is to ensure that developers [build a product](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/ux-brand-perception) with the users’ mental model in mind.

Mental models tend to differ between different countries and cultures. So, to take the bicycle example, in the UK a front brake has to be on the right handlebar (both for reasons of expectation and legality), however this is switched around for the US and Europe.

This is also true of the web.

Take a look at Facebook in two different territories. The first image below is a Middle Eastern version of the sign-up page. The second is the UK version.

People in the middle east write from right to left, whereas people in the west write from left to right. Developers need to understand this in order to build a usable website.
