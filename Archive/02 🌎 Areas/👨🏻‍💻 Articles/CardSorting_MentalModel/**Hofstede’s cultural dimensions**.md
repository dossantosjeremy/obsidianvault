## **Hofstede’s cultural dimensions**

Based on analysis of an IBM survey of employee values in the early 70s, Hofstede discovered that there were significant differences among cultures in different countries and he defined culture as a set of shared characteristics, such as thoughts, values and behaviors.

Here’s an example of this at work…

Take a look at the homepage below and try to answer the following questions: where is this website from and what is the purpose?

![](https://images.prismic.io/userzoom/467cac9d-5b8c-4d7b-83ba-5271395b43af_Screen-Shot-2017-10-03-at-13.40.04-1024x524.png?auto=compress,format&w=1800)

We asked these questions of our webinar attendees, and although most guessed the correct country (Japan) many were way off with the purpose. Incorrect answers include ‘gardening’, ‘a version of Amazon’, ‘kids video game’, ‘document storage’, ‘environmental’, and ‘business cats’.

Many of these are examples of common mental models – people see the green and assume something garden or environment because of their own experience within our culture.

However this homepage is in fact a banking website. Our idea of what a banking website looks like in the UK is very different to how a banking site looks in Japan. Here’s a typical UK banking site.

If you asked a Japanese web developer to build a banking website for a UK audience, their cultural perception would be very different to what the UK audience expects.

Hofstede’s cultural dimensions are split into six categories, and here is where we measure the difference between cultures and countries.

1.  Power distance
2.  Uncertainty avoidance
3.  Individualism vs. collectivism
4.  Masculinity vs. femininity
5.  Long vs. short-term time orientation
6.  Indulgence

The last two have been added recently by other thinkers, but for our purposes, we’ll only be discussing the first four theories.

So how do these dimensions come into play with [user experience design](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/ux-design-process)?

Just as a caveat, these are generalizations of the countries and cultures and are based on Hofstede’s theories. They do not necessarily reflect our own thoughts or experience.

can### **Power distance**

This is the extent to which the people of a particular culture are willing to accept unequal power distribution.

Countries with a high power distance tend to experience:

-   Centralized decision making.
-   Management and superiors are highly respected and have the last say in decisions.

Countries with a low power distance:

-   Everyone expects to share in decision making.
-   Management hierarchies are flatter and more open to questioning.

In high power distance cultures, an employee will never question a manager. In lower power distance cultures, employees are encouraged to have an open dialogue with management.

For design purposes, what could work well in high power distance countries would be introducing [visuals](https://www.usertesting.com/resources/templates/visual-design-evaluation), expressions and images with authoritative body language, that are informative and guiding. Whereas low power distance cultures may prefer activities of daily life, popular images, symbols and colors.

### **Uncertainty Avoidance (UA)**

This is the extent to which a society fears and avoids uncertainty and uncertain outcomes.

Countries with a high uncertainty avoidance tend to have:

-   Strictly defined rules of behavior and formality
-   Things that are different or unexplained can be viewed as dangerous

Countries with low uncertainty avoidance:

-   Willingness to take risks
-   More experimentation and/or innovative behavior

Countries with high uncertainty avoidance fear change and don’t like ambiguity – they also probably have more laws and legislation. Countries with a low UA are more willing to take risks and are more flexible in the way they work.

Design for a high UA culture may include:

-   Simple clear design, limited choices.
-   Attempts to reveal or forecast the results or implications of actions before users act.
-   Navigation schemes intended to prevent users from becoming lost.
-   Help systems that focus on reducing user errors.
-   Redundant cues, color, [typography](https://www.userzoom.com/blog/ux-guide-to-typography/), sound, etc. to reduce ambiguity.

Low UA cultures would emphasize the reverse:

-   Maximum content and choice.
-   Acceptance even encouragement of wandering and risk, with a stigma on ‘over-protection’.
-   Less control of navigation; for example, links might open new windows leading away from the original location.
-   Mental models and help systems might focus on understanding underlying concepts rather than narrow tasks.

For an example, check out the Starbucks website in China (a low UA country)…

There’s loads of text, lots of categories, navigation and links – it’s the maximum amount of information jammed into a lengthy webpage.

And here’s the Starbucks website in France (a high UA country).

There are fewer elements, [navigation](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/the-navigation-treasure-trove-37-menu-usability-resources) is scaled back to the bare minimum, there’s one focused CTA. The full length of the page is half that of the Chinese example.

### **Individualism vs. collectivism**

The extent to which people in the society define themselves as part of larger groups.

Countries with high individualism tend to experience:

-   Social ties that are loose
-   Individuals expected to look after themselves

Countries with high collectivism:

-   Individuals are strongly incorporated into groups of family, clan, school
-   Government policies often favor the group over individual rights

When it comes to design, content based on materialism and consumerism will work well in individualistic countries, whereas content that represents community and harmony will work in highly collectivist countries.

For example, here’s a dating website from Venezuela (a collectivist country), full of many different faces looking out towards the visitor.

And here’s the same dating website in Italy (an individualistic country), which features a young couple, looking at one another.

### **Masculinity vs. Femininity**

The extent to which a society favors certain gender traits.

Countries that value high masculinity:

-   Favor assertiveness
-   Emphasis on competition

Countries that value high femininity:

-   Focus on quality of life
-   Importance placed on the well-being of relationships

A website in a country that values high masculinity may favor competition and talk about how you can grow and better yourself. A website from a culture with high femininity may concentrate on wellbeing, relationships and the value of life.

### **Takeaways**

An [ecommerce](https://www.usertesting.com/blog/usability-testing-ecommerce-business) store will use a trolley or a basket to signify the place your online goods are stored, because that’s what we use in the physical world. It would be no good for web designers to use another symbol – a hat, a puppy, a cog – because we’ve already built the mental model in our culture.

So you can see that mental models are handy for translating real world activities to the digital world. 

When Apple introduced the iPhone and users had to swipe or tap to access features after putting in their password, we created a new mental model. Now we’re all used to entering our password at the beginning of our lock-screen. If the password appeared after the swipe – this would be an unnatural mental model.

Ultimately, the gap between developers and the users needs to be brought closer. Developers need to understand a culture’s various mental models and core values in order to truly build a user-friendly experience. As Edward T Hall said, “The information is in the people, not in your head.”
