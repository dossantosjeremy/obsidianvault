#### Ingredients for 5 Smoked Turkey Pasta servings

-   1 tablespoon olive oil
-   13oz smoked turkey sausage, cut into 1-inch pieces
-   4 garlic cloves, minced
-   1 medium (white) onion, chopped
-   Two 15oz (30oz) no salt added canned crushed tomatoes
-   2 Ramen noodle chicken seasoning packets
-   *1 tablespoon Italian seasoning (if you have it – optional but recommended)*
-   10oz whole wheat pasta (or your choice
-   2 ½ cups water
-   16oz frozen spinach
-   Sea salt & pepper to taste
-   Garnish
    -   Fresh lemon

#### Steps

##### Step 1

Set a large pot on medium high heat. Once hot add olive oil and sausage.  Cook the sausage until sear marks appear along the edges, about 3 minutes.  Reduce the heat to medium.

##### Step 2

Add garlic, onion, tomatoes, seasoning, pasta and water. Bring to a simmer.  Use tongs to stir the pasta as it cooks and softens.  Continually stir and fold the ingredients together as the pasta cooks, about 8 – 10 minutes. Cover the pot if needed but monitor to make sure it is not burning, and as more liquid as needed.

##### Step 3

When the pasta is nearly 95% cooked, fold in the frozen spinach to thaw.

##### Step 4

Season to taste with sea salt & pepper.
