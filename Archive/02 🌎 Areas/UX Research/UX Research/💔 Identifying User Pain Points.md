# Pain Points


Pain points are any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need. 


# Four Pain Points Categories

* Financial pain points are user problems related to, you guessed it, money. If you've ever gotten lost in an online article, only to be rudely interrupted by a paywall, you know all about these.
* There are also product pain points. These are usually quality issues related to the product. 
* Next up, there are process pain points. These are frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B. 
* And finally, there are support pain points. When users interact with your product, they might have questions. If they can't find answers to their questions, they won't feel supported. Customer service information that's hidden on a website falls into this category.
