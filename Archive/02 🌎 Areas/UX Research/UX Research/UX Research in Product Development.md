# Goals of UX Research
- Understanding User Behaviors
- Understanding User Needs
- Understanding User Motivations

# Types of User Research

## Foundational User Research
- Empathize with users
- Understanding their needs
- Inspire new design directions
- Make personas
- Make user stories
- Figure out the user needs and how to address them with a product

### Questions 
- What should we build?
- What are the user’s problems?
- How can we solve those problems?
- Am I aware of my own biases, and am I able to filter them as I do research?

### Foundational User Research Methods
- **Interviews:** A research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. 
- **Surveys:** Understand what most people think about a product.
- **Focus groups:** Study the reactions of a group of users by discussing about their perspectives on a feature of the design. 
- **Competitive audit:** An overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. 
- **Field studies:** Research activities that take place in the user's context or personal environment, rather than in an office or lab.
- **Diary studies:** A research method used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. 

### Design Research
* ***Design research**: Happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the needs of users, and to reduce risk. 

## Question

How should we build it? 

### Design Research Methods

- Usability Study: Evaluate a product by testing it on users. Identify pain points that the user experiences with your prototypes, so the issues can be fixed before the product launches.
- **A/B testing**: A research method that evaluates and compares two different aspects of a product to discover which of them is most effective. 
- **Cafe or guerrilla studies:** A research method where user feedback is gathered by taking a design or prototype into the public domain and asking passersby for their thoughts. 
- **Card sorting:** A research method that instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them. This type of research is largely used to figure out the information architecture of your project
- **Intercepts:** A research method that gathers on-site feedback from users as they engage in the activities being researched. Intercepts are often conducted in the field, so this type of research is often considered a subset of field research. An intercept study can provide quick, high-level feedback.

## Post Launch Research

* ***Post-launch research** : post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five)
* To help validate that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.
* To tell how your final product is performing based on established metrics, such as adoption, usage, user satisfaction, and more.

### Question 

Did we succeed? 

In post-launch research, your goal is to answer the question: Did we succeed? This research will 

### Post Launch Research Methods

- **A/B testing**
- **Usability studies**
- **Surveys**
- **Logs analysis:** A research method used to evaluate recordings of users while they interact with your design, tools, etc.
