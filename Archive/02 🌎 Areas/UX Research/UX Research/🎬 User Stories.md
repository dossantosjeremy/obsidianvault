# Format

* As a **type of user** (who), I want to **action** (what) so that **benefit** (why).
* To write a user story, follow this simple formula: A sentence that highlights different parts of the statement. As a type of user = WHO, I want to action (WHAT) so that benefit (WHY).
* The “type of user” describes who you are designing for.
- The “action” is what the user hopes will happen.
- The “benefit” is why the user wants the action to happen.

# Best practice

* The best practice for user stories is to keep them short, impactful, and to the point, with a clear action and benefit.
* The personas and user stories should be here to represent the needs of users. 

# Steps to follow

1. Identify the user types
2. Consider pain points
3. Identify user actions (actions that will help them have a better experience)
4. Benefits of the user: Consider why each user might want to perform the action you selected and how it would benefit them. 
5. Review user stories and make sure they clearly identify: The type of user, the action the user hopes will happen and the benefit the user will get from the completed action. 

# Summary
* Follows a simple format: As a (Type of User) (Who) I want to action (What) so that  Benefit (Why)
* Keep them short, impactful and to the point
* Articulate the users' action and the benefit they seek
* Use them as a checklist to address key user problems in the product design
* Keep user stories in mind as we design a product
* They should represent the needs of users we are designing for. The more detailed and accurate the better
