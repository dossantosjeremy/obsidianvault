# Questions to have in mind to recruit participants

- Do my users have impairments or disabilities to considerâ€“whether temporary, situational, or permanent?
- How familiar are my users with technology?
- How are my users accessing the product or service?
- Where and when are my users accessing the product or service?
- Have I considered all my potential users?
- Consider income level
- Consider demographic data such as age
- Consider Gender
- Consider Ethnicity
- Consider Educational Background
- Consider Geographic Location


# Deep dive into each aspect
## Impairments or disability

* The termÂ **accessibility**Â refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. 
* Accessibility is about making products accessible to all people, whether they have a disability or not. Think about inclusive product features that increase magnification, like enlarged fonts. Or features that help everyone understand videos, like closed captions.

## Familiarity with Technology

- Have the digital litteracy in mind
- Ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.
- For instance, someone with a limited digital literacy might not know what swipe means
- They may not even know what a touchscreen is. This can affect their confidence and willingness to explore new technology.

## **How are my users accessing the product or service?**

- Not all users will access services in the same way due to cost and availability of internet
- Take the offline experience into account as well:Â _[Offline UX design guidelines](https://web.dev/offline-ux-design-guidelines/)_Â 

## **Where are my users accessing the product or service?**

- People can be accessing from various parts of the world, creating additional considerationsÃ§
- Local languages, cultural norms 
- Identify shifts in user problems, preferences and usage patterns over time. 
- users might need to switch languages on their device
- For instance a user might want to read in Hindi and type in another language

# Where to recruit participants

## **Start recruiting participants**
- **Personal network.**Â Family, friends, or colleagues who fit the demographics of the target users youâ€™re designing for.

- **Online.**Â 
	- Social media to find participants or websites created specifically like UserTesting or UserInterviews.
	- Posting on online communities. Before you post in an online community, make sure to check group rules or ask an administrator for permission to ask for research participation!
- **Hallway testing.**Â 
	- If recruiting a small number of participnats
	- If you have limited time
	- If you want to conduct research for free. 
	- However all the participants might not have the characteristics of the participants you need
- **Third-party recruiting agencies.**Â
