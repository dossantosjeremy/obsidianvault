# About Personas

## Definition

* Personas* are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.
* Each persona that you create will represent a group of users with similar characteristics that you’ve learned about through your research. 
* A fictional representation of a user segment, embodying their characteristics, needs and behaviors. 

## **Constituents of a Persona**

Consider the questions below as you reflect on your work:

1. Your persona is a fictional representation inspired by a group of interviews and not an exact reflection of any single individual.
1. Demographic Information that should match the persona characteristic (age, education...)
2. **Quote:** Relevant to the persona and the background we built for him, communicating the persona attitude and personality. Summarizes your persona’s personality, along with a paragraph describing their life.
3. **Goals: list of goals that the persona wants to complete
4. Frustrations: frustrations for issues they encounter or try to avoid. 
The _goals_ and _frustrations_ sections of the template should highlight the trending goals and frustrations across all of your “interviews.”
1. **Brief story/scenario:** Tying goals, frustrations and their quotes. Convey the persona user journey with goals, frustrations and other relevant context. 
2. **Image:** Include a picture or avatar representing the persona

# **Building personas**

- Personas are created by conducting user research and identifying common **pain points**, which are UX issues that frustrate and block the user from getting what they need from a product
- As you create personas, look for the most common themes in your data and group the users who personify those themes together. 
- Generally, creating 3 to 8 personas is enough to represent the majority of a product’s user base. 
- **Pro tip:** Get your team's opinion on the product’s users before you build personas. Then, after you build personas, review those suggestions from your team and compare them to the personas you created. 
- **Personas** are fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users. These user groups are determined by identifying similar responses, behaviors, or characteristics shared among multiple research participants 

## Determine the number of users to interview

For a real project, you would have at least 4-6 real interview subjects for each group of users (at least 8-12 total).
## Gather demographic information
- Location
- Age range
- Education level
- Employment
- Household/family composition
- Other key personal identifiers
- Ability
- Gender identity
- Race and ethnicity
- Language
## Gather information regarding the target user's life
* Goals
* Frustrations*

# Questions to ask yourself

- Did the demographic information match the characteristics derived from the user groups represented in your original notes?
- Does your quote showcase each persona's personality?
- Were the goals and frustrations aligned with the personas and the activity scenario?
- Were you able to give more information about the personas, tying in their goals and frustrations, as well as their quote?
- What were the key identifiable differences between your two personas that ensured you were thinking about different user groups and why did you choose them?
- Did you include a picture or avatar representing each of the personas for your activity?
