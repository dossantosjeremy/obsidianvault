_This practice activity is an opportunity for you to apply the concepts that you learned throughout the course. We provide a completed example activity so you can compare and contrast your ideas, designs, and grow as a user experience designer._

This activity will help you track a user‚Äôs experience by creating a user journey map. A¬†**user journey**¬†is the series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal.

In this activity, you‚Äôll craft two user journey maps for the personas we created in the reading¬†[Creating personas for the CoffeeHouse project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/supplement/8gTyx/exemplar-creating-personas-for-the-coffeehouse-project). Go back and reference the two personas in that reading before continuing with this activity.

Your approach to creating a user journey map depends on what stage of the design process you‚Äôre in. For instance, if you are in the early stages of a project and don‚Äôt have a working product yet, your journey map would track the general experience the user goes through to complete their goal. In that situation, actions the user takes would look something like this:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9iC1TLm7RCegtUy5u5QnxA_0d3bbfec238c4cdca56c137de8e978f1_Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-12.17.11-PM.png?expiry=1683676800000&hmac=eoudeYwNKXBThb08SX-ML-vSXziN2mWLxA6fUlE6M5Y](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/9iC1TLm7RCegtUy5u5QnxA_0d3bbfec238c4cdca56c137de8e978f1_Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-12.17.11-PM.png?expiry=1683676800000&hmac=eoudeYwNKXBThb08SX-ML-vSXziN2mWLxA6fUlE6M5Y)

Notice that the actions in the example above are less about what will appear in the product, and more on how the user goes about their day while trying to accomplish their goal.

If you‚Äôre further along in the design process, for example, if this was for a redesign of the CoffeeHouse app, your user journey map would probably include the user interacting directly with your product. In this case, the user's actions might look more like this:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/CtKHTXQ7ToeSh010O66H6w_f2f307f5e10649b5b51f13fe3dd2fff1_Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-12.19.02-PM.png?expiry=1683676800000&hmac=DnJrIrxQ-7fIzCvEBjUWC4kAzGJ-L7wt83an8UoCbVU](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/CtKHTXQ7ToeSh010O66H6w_f2f307f5e10649b5b51f13fe3dd2fff1_Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-12.19.02-PM.png?expiry=1683676800000&hmac=DnJrIrxQ-7fIzCvEBjUWC4kAzGJ-L7wt83an8UoCbVU)

Since you‚Äôre just starting the design process for creating a product, your journey map should track the user‚Äôs general experience of what they go through to achieve their goals. Use what you‚Äôve learned in your research and be creative as you put yourself in the user‚Äôs shoes!

The benefits of user journey maps include:

- Helping UX designers create obstacle-free paths for users
- Highlighting pain points
- Identifying improvement opportunities
- Reducing the impact of designer bias

Follow the directions below to craft user journey maps for the two personas we created based on the CoffeeHouse scenario.

## **Step 2: Add your first persona's name and goals**

Refer back to the first persona and user story we created for the CoffeeHouse scenario. Base your first user journey on that persona, and use their user story as a guide to fill out the template.

- Add the name of the first persona to the top of the template.
- Identify a business goal the management team might like to achieve. Add the goal to your template just below the persona section at the top. For example:

![https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hvEEQNQ7T-axBEDUO1_m1A_9f3e2601fb4a497b9fb7a10b8d031df1_Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-12.24.34-PM.png?expiry=1683676800000&hmac=wFwAIZc-0zqohwBCkXzoAzWgG3tVnpRcccw5AONUFJQ](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/hvEEQNQ7T-axBEDUO1_m1A_9f3e2601fb4a497b9fb7a10b8d031df1_Screen-Shot-2021-07-08-at-12.24.34-PM.png?expiry=1683676800000&hmac=wFwAIZc-0zqohwBCkXzoAzWgG3tVnpRcccw5AONUFJQ)

## **Step 3: Fill out the user journey map template**

When filling out the template, follow these steps:

- Add each action the persona takes in their journey to achieve their goal.
- Add 2-3 tasks for each action.
- Indicate how the user feels at each point. Be as specific as possible. What does the user feel as they experience each step in their journey? Try to empathize with the user's experience as much as possible.
- Add opportunities for improvement. These can be ideas that would help resolve the cause of a negative user experience, or ones that take a positive part of the user‚Äôs experience and build upon it.
- Be proactive and include accessibility considerations.
- When you're finished, go back and check for biases in your assumptions and ideas.

You can also refer to the example we worked through in the lesson where we mapped Jamal's user journey as he pursued his goal of visiting the top of the Empire State Building in New York City.

Some tips to consider:

1. Think about some real-world examples to help you understand how a user uses a product or service like yours.
2. Include both positive and negative experiences.
3. Think of opportunities that will improve the negative experiences and build upon the positive ones.
4. Check along the way for opportunities to consider accessibility and avoid bias.

## **Step 4: Repeat the process for the second persona and user story**

Download or make a copy of the user journey map template. Then, follow the instructions in steps two and three for the second persona. Once you finish this step, you should have two completed user journey maps, one for each persona.

## **Step 5: Reflect on the completion of this activity**

As you reflect on the user journey maps you‚Äôve created, make sure you:

- Defined all of the actions along the user‚Äôs journey.
- Captured 2-3 tasks for each action and identified at least one feeling.
- Indicated how the user felt at each point.
- Identified improvement opportunities for each step of the user journey.
- Considered accessibility for each step of the user journey map and explored ways to reduce the impact of designer bias.

# Activity Exemplar: Create user journey maps for the CoffeeHouse project

Here are examples of completed user journey maps for the user personas of the CoffeeHouse app, Anika and Ali. There's also an explanation of how the examples fulfill the expectations of the activity.

In the examples above, the user journey maps meet the following criteria:

- All of the actions along the user‚Äôs journey are defined.
- 2-3 tasks are captured for each action.
- The user's feelings are indicated at each point in their journey.
- Improvement opportunities are identified for each step of the user's journey.
- The user journey maps consider accessibility and explore ways to reduce the impact of designer bias.

Now compare the exemplars above to your completed user journey maps. Assess what you‚Äôve done using each of the criteria used to evaluate the exemplar. Do your user journey maps meet each of the criteria above?

If you answered "yes," then well done! If not, reread the instructions and amend your user journey maps with these criteria in mind.
