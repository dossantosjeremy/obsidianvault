Here are some examples of common research goals when it comes to empathizing with users:

- I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
- I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
- I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product Iâ€™m designing.

Additional Questions
1. Are there certain user problems or pain points we need to empathize with
2. What are the characteristics of users we want to interview and why?
3. How much information should we have to make sure we have a balance set of data?
