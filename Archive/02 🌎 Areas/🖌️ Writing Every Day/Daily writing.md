It's crazy how songs take meaning when I think of you and our story. 
There is a before, and an after. 
I closed my eyes for a while, and, although I would have never thought, the explosive sound of tambours was calming me. The group was able to perfectly represent the state of my inner mind and emotions. The sound could not be louder. Paradoxically, that is the only moment I felt at peace. As I could not cry, as I could not scream loud enough to experience catharsis, these men were helping me feeling the emotion I should feel. 
How is it possible to feel that you met the one person you will ever only love? What to do if this person escaped you? What to do if this person made it very clear when leaving she did not want to have you in her life? 

You said you thought about me. You said you had flashbacks. The only message I received from you was 2 years after you left me. On my personal email. You had access to every possible and imaginable channel to reach out to me, in 2 years. My whole familiy's numbers. My email. Social Media. Everything. 

You know when they say what would you do if you had all the money in the wolrd? Well, I would take more risks. You know what comes to mind when I think of more risks? Take the first plane to go see you and read you this letter out loud. What should you do, when you realize that this would be your life goal? 

What to do when you feel love is not reciprocated? Somewhere in the back of my mind, I always felt this. But then I got fooled by all these times when you tried to catch me back again. It's like if you want me near without being actually with me. All these times we had for ourselves, and you preferred to have your family or other people coming over. You were uncomfortable being alone with me. You looked unhappy the day you finally moved in with me. You never at least let me know what was wrong with how I treated you. This is the very minimal thing to do when you love someone. 

And you have this crazy attitude to always make me feel like I am the one responsible for what happened between us. You left me. I tried everything to make you come to reason. Told you I loved you. Told you I would do everything to make it work. Asking you to tell me what was wrong with me. 

You were - and maybe are - today still the one I saw myself married with. 

You know how we can see that the relationship was unbalanced? Compromises. Sacrifice. If you told me right now you needed to talk to me  because you believed I was the one and you did not want to mess this up, I would take the first flight I could to go see you in any city you are in right now. That is, by the way, in 10 lines, what I expressed to you when you reached out to me recently. Let's talk to each other, face to face, in Lisbon. Appearances may communicate something else. But I was single when I messaged you. You were not. I already gives us an idea of each ones' motives. 


A brief appearance. A silhouette. That is all it takes. For everything to resurface. I could not see your face. But for a while, knowing you were less than 10 meters away from me, without the ability to tell you everything I wanted, kills me from the inside. And at the same time, what would this have changed? We had all the opportunities we could ever have asked for. I remember asking you to discuss for a week straight when you announced me you wanted to leave me. All you wanted was for me to leave you alone. I was broken. Shattered to pieces. I saw myself married to you. Growing old together. Raise a family together. I knew things were not going to be perfect. But I would have given my everything. This I can promise. 

I do not understand. They say when someone wants to be with you, they will let you know, and they will let you know very clearly. With you, it has always been unclear. How can you send me a long email telling me you have flashbacks and think about me, and answer me I cannot be in Lisbon when I tell you let's talk? Or let me know where I should go see you? Or offer me an alternative date? Or offer me to talk over email or phone? The only answer I got was "I will not be in Lisbon at this date. What do you want to talk about?". I am sorry. It hurts. But it is not good enough for me. Over the years and thanks to you, I have learned that there is one thing more important than you: myself. Although you made the effort and sacrifice to come live with me, I made the huge sacrifice and efforts when it comes to my ability to trust, knowing our turbulent past, to let you into my life. So, what should I do when I receive this kind of email? Sorry, but I have no good answer for you. Again, I would give everything. Everything means, if you tell me you want to call, if you tell me you want to see me, I will do everything I can. But this is not the answer I received. Instead, I received "I am thinking about you and having flashbacks", before "what do you want to talk about, I am with someone, I cannot be in Lisbon". The words I would have loved to read: Yes, let's talk. I am with someone, but I will end it. Because I want to be with you. Let's find a day and a place. 

7 years. 10 years knowing you. That is a lot. That was intense. I learned a lot. About me included. Sometimes I get myself to think. I cannot believe this story ended. I truly believe we have something spectacular. Our story gave me goosebumps. I loved everything about you. 

I always felt you were avoiding me. But this kept increasing over the years. Then, the weird happened. You would go to Portugal without me. For me, nothing wrong, perfectly fine, that is actually something I suggested you a long time ago. But you never liked the idea. You liked the idea of us sharing everything together. While sometimes it ended up suffocating me a bit, I understood and loved the idea. I honestly feel fooled sometimes. Because this happened before we had this huge argument ending up in you not talking to me. You were already changing. 

I miss you. I feel trapped. No escape. Just me accepting we will not end up together. You must now live in Paris. I live in Barcelona. Even the logistics make it difficult. For anyone from the outside, it would be "crazy" just to start considering seeing each other again. However, don't know why, not so crazy to me. I feel I made this voice that wanted to scream 3 years ago shut up. But I also feel it could escape anytime now. It would just need the stars to be aligned. And this weekend, something happened in me. The stars were almost aligned. Problem is, with time, I realized stars will never be aligned on their own. We have to give them a little push. That is what I used to do. In 2013, I went 2 months to Portugal, and a big reason behind that is that I wanted to be with you. 

I honestly did not appreciate you say to everyone you are sorry for my grandparent's loss. But not to me. Your cousin found me on Instagram. You sent me an email. You know how to reach out. Why did not you? If you cared about me. I cannot get it. 


Day 2
Your cousin took away his friend request. I liked having this request because for me it meant, in a way, that you kept thinking about me. However, I understand why you would think I do not anymore. You saw me with another girl. And I almost feel bad for this. But at the same time, what did you think? You left. After countless times of me saying don't leave. You say you tried to reach, but you never did. In 2 years, I received nothing from you. You started your life again since you started dating someone else. What would getting back together mean now? That both you and I did not find someone better for us. Pretty sad, isnt it? On top of that, even if I like to think your cousin reached out, what would that be for? Speaking to me? To say what? Why can't you speak to me? Why would you avoid any discussion with me? Why do I have the impression that to be able to speak to you, I almost have to pay for it? Your words have always been very limited to me. When you left, having you at least explain why was a total failure. Then, during 2 years, radio silence. Then, you limit yourself to 2 emails. 2 emails. If you really wanted to see me, that is not what you would have made. 
I remember you saying to my mum when you left: In truth, it has not been 7 years we are together. It's only 2, because we have been living together only 2 years. That pretty much sums it all. I think I miss an idealized version of you. And you might miss an idealized version of me. I really struggled to believe you, over the years. The part of taking action is always missing. It is always you talking to me, making me come to you, but there is no action from your side. Like now: Why would your cousin ask me as a friend? Cannot he write a message? On Instagram? On Facebook? There are so many ways. No, that is not what you want. You want to see how well I am doing so you can destroy it. For you, I only have value if I am not available. You reached out to me last time because you discovered I changed life and that I had a girlfriend. Not because you missed me. And the lack of action also shows you are not committed. You just want me committed. I sometimes think I will have to live the rest of this life with this sour taste and feeling. Truth is, I have no other way. Your cousin asking me on Instagram is not you coming to me. Your cousin saying hello on the main place is not you coming to me. You telling me you cannot go see me, that you have someone, and asking me why I want to talk, is not you coming to me.
