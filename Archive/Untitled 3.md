  \<div style="flex: 1;"\>  
    \<ul\>  
      \<li\>\<strong\>Project Context:\</strong\> The Courier Contact Tree project aimed to improve the experience couriers have with a contact tree used for support issues, initially designed in 2019.\</li\>  
      \<li\>\<strong\>Key Challenge:\</strong\> The existing contact tree was not aligned with the mental models of couriers, leading to inefficiencies and increased need for human intervention.\</li\>  
      \<li\>\<strong\>Main Approach:\</strong\> The project employed moderated user sessions, card sorting, and usability testing to explore couriers' mental models and validate a new design proposal.\</li\>  
      \<li\>\<strong\>Primary Impact:\</strong\> Redesigned contact tree improved usability, helping couriers resolve issues efficiently and reducing courier-agent contact ratio by targeting pain points such as content findability and interface clarity.\</li\>

\#\# ðŸŽ¯ \*\*3. Research Goals, Hypotheses & Recruitment\*\*

\#\#\# \*\*Research Goals\*\*  
\> \[\!INFO\] Goals    
\> \- \*\*Primary Goal\*\*: Improve couriers' experience of the contact tree by aligning it with their mental models and assessing usability improvements.    
\> \- \*\*Research Questions\*\*:    
\>   \- \*\*Q1\*\*: How might we redesign the contact tree so that it fits couriers' preferences and expectations?    
\>   \- \*\*Q2\*\*: How could we improve the couriers' mental models so that they more accurately reflect the contact tree?  

\#\#\# \*\*Hypotheses\*\*  
\> \[\!NOTE\] Hypotheses    
\> \- \*\*H1\*\*: Restructuring the content of the contact tree will better fit couriers' preferences and expectations.    
\> \- \*\*H2\*\*: Redesigning the interface will increase usability and help couriers find information more easily.  

\#\#\# \*\*Recruitment\*\*  
\> \[\!TIP\] Recruitment    
\> \- \*\*Target Participants\*\*: 10 Moroccan couriers, a mix of new and experienced users.    
\> \- \*\*Recruitment Approach\*\*: French language considerations, direct contact ratio analysis, and participant incentives of 15 euros or 160 DAM for 60 minutes.

\#\# ðŸ§ª \*\*4. Analysis\*\*

\> \[\!NOTE\] Analysis Process    
\> \- \*\*Data Processing\*\*: Utilized card sorting and usability testing results to refine design proposals.    
\> \- \*\*Frameworks\*\*: Employed thematic analysis for insights and recommendations.  

\---

\#\# ðŸŒŸ \*\*5. Findings & Recommendations\*\*

\#\#\# \*\*Finding 1 & Recommendation\*\*

\> \[\!NOTE\] Finding 1    
\> \*\*Finding\*\*: Couriers prioritize efficiency and ease of finding content, forming groups based on frequency, category, and severity during card sorting.    
\> \*\*Recommendation\*\*: High priority to redesign Layer 1 by grouping content based on couriers' preferences to enhance flexibility and speed.  

\#\#\# \*\*Finding 2 & Recommendation\*\*

\> \[\!NOTE\] Finding 2    
\> \*\*Finding\*\*: The wording used in the contact tree is not understandable, adding cognitive load.    
\> \*\*Recommendation\*\*: High priority to use familiar words and consistent phrasing, tailored to delivery phases, to reduce cognitive strain on couriers.  

\#\#\# \*\*Finding 3 & Recommendation\*\*

\> \[\!NOTE\] Finding 3    
\> \*\*Finding\*\*: The process for changing addresses at delivery points is unclear, with multiple entry points leading to inefficiency.    
\> \*\*Recommendation\*\*: Medium priority to streamline by creating a unified flow for address changes and potentially improving self-service solutions.

\#\# ðŸ“– \*\*6. Project Story\*\*

\> \[\!INFO\] Project Story    
\> \- \*\*Problem Description\*\*: Existing contact tree not aligned with couriers' mental models, leading to inefficiencies and unnecessary agent contact.    
\> \- \*\*Complexity\*\*: Balancing business objectives with user needs; ensuring ease of use across diverse courier experiences.    
\> \- \*\*Stakeholders Affected\*\*: Couriers experiencing delays and increased workload; agents receiving unnecessary contacts.    
\> \- \*\*Approach\*\*: Conducted card sorting and usability tests followed by design iteration and validation.    
\> \- \*\*Obstacles\*\*: Language barriers, diverse courier experiences, and the initial contact tree design's complexity.    
\> \- \*\*Solutions\*\*: Updated interface with intuitive design elements and clearer language to better align with user needs.

\#\# ðŸ’¡ \*\*7. Reflection\*\*

\> \[\!TIP\] Reflection    
\> \- \*\*Success Factors\*\*: Input from couriers directly informed design decisions leading to a more intuitive contact tree.    
\> \- \*\*Challenges\*\*: Addressing complex mental model mappings into a simplified interface.    
\> \- \*\*Learnings\*\*: Importance of aligning business tools with end-user mental models for usability.    
\> \- \*\*Next Steps\*\*: Further validation through unmoderated usability testing across diverse markets.
