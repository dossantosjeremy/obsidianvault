## 💬 **1. Executive Summary**

  

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">

  <div style="flex: 1;">

    <ul>

      <li><strong>Project Context:</strong> The Courier Contact Tree project aimed to improve the experience couriers have with a contact tree used for support issues, initially designed in 2019.</li>

      <li><strong>Key Challenge:</strong> The existing contact tree was not aligned with the mental models of couriers, leading to inefficiencies and increased need for human intervention.</li>

      <li><strong>Main Approach:</strong> The project employed moderated user sessions, card sorting, and usability testing to explore couriers' mental models and validate a new design proposal.</li>

      <li><strong>Primary Impact:</strong> Redesigned contact tree improved usability, helping couriers resolve issues efficiently and reducing courier-agent contact ratio by targeting pain points such as content findability and interface clarity.</li>

    </ul>

## 🎯 **3. Research Goals, Hypotheses & Recruitment**

### **Research Goals**

> [!INFO] Goals  

> - **Primary Goal**: Improve couriers' experience of the contact tree by aligning it with their mental models and assessing usability improvements.  

> - **Research Questions**:  

>   - **Q1**: How might we redesign the contact tree so that it fits couriers' preferences and expectations?  

>   - **Q2**: How could we improve the couriers' mental models so that they more accurately reflect the contact tree?  

  

### **Hypotheses**

> [!NOTE] Hypotheses  

> - **H1**: Restructuring the content of the contact tree will better fit couriers' preferences and expectations.  

> - **H2**: Redesigning the interface will increase usability and help couriers find information more easily.  

  

### **Recruitment**

> [!TIP] Recruitment  

> - **Target Participants**: 10 Moroccan couriers, a mix of new and experienced users.  

> - **Recruitment Approach**: French language considerations, direct contact ratio analysis, and participant incentives of 15 euros or 160 DAM for 60 minutes.

## 🧪 **4. Analysis**

  

> [!NOTE] Analysis Process  

> - **Data Processing**: Utilized card sorting and usability testing results to refine design proposals.  

> - **Frameworks**: Employed thematic analysis for insights and recommendations.  

  

---

  

## 🌟 **5. Findings & Recommendations**

  

### **Finding 1 & Recommendation**

  

> [!NOTE] Finding 1  

> **Finding**: Couriers prioritize efficiency and ease of finding content, forming groups based on frequency, category, and severity during card sorting.  

> **Recommendation**: High priority to redesign Layer 1 by grouping content based on couriers' preferences to enhance flexibility and speed.  

### **Finding 2 & Recommendation**

> [!NOTE] Finding 2  

> **Finding**: The wording used in the contact tree is not understandable, adding cognitive load.  

> **Recommendation**: High priority to use familiar words and consistent phrasing, tailored to delivery phases, to reduce cognitive strain on couriers.  

  

### **Finding 3 & Recommendation**

  

> [!NOTE] Finding 3  

> **Finding**: The process for changing addresses at delivery points is unclear, with multiple entry points leading to inefficiency.  

> **Recommendation**: Medium priority to streamline by creating a unified flow for address changes and potentially improving self-service solutions.
