### 5. HANDSTANDS

[[BookFusion/Books/Complete Calisthenics The Ultimate Guide To Bodyweight Exercise-4306013|Complete Calisthenics: The Ultimate Guide To Bodyweight Exercise]]

> # 5. HANDSTANDS 
> 
>  
> 
> The third group of upper body pushing exercises are the handstands. Handstands literally place a demand on every muscle group in the body, from the hands, shoulders, back, core, and lower body. Developing the handstand will be a major achievement in your calisthenics training. If you think about it, your legs are the strongest part of the body for the fact that they have to carry around your entire bodyweight all day, every day. Spending time in the handstand will develop the upper body the same way that walking, squatting lunging, and running does for the lower body.
> 
>  
> 
> There are many different variations of the handstand and we will look at all of them in this section. The first task is to perfect the free balancing handstand. There a number of stages to this and we will look at those next.
> 
> #  5.1 WALL WALKS
> 
>  
> 
> If you have never tried handstands then you may be very apprehensive about positioning your body upside down, and in my experience this can be the major stumbling block for the majority of people. In order to progress with the handstand group of exercises you must be completely confident when your body is inverted. To build this confidence we can use an exercise called handstand wall walks. This movement will allow you to become more comfortable in the handstand position, and will also build real strength in the shoulders.
> 
>  
> 
> You will need to have a solid wall that will be able to bear your weight, and that has no obstacles to the front or side. It may also be a good idea to use mats to ensure you feel safe enough to progress with the exercise.
> 
>  
> 
> 1\. To perform the handstand wall walk, place your feet at the bottom of the wall and get into a normal push-up position.
> 
>  
> 
> 2\. From here start to walk your feet up the wall. At the same time start to move your hands back towards the wall. Take small steps and keep your arms and legs as straight as possible.
> 
>  
> 
> 3\. As you move up the wall keep your core as tight as you can, and do not let your hips drop towards the wall. Keep your head in a neutral position.
> 
>  
> 
> 4\. Walk your feet up the wall as far as you are able to. Start off by getting the body into a forty five degree angle, and as you get stronger and more confident, start to move further and further up. Hold this position for a couple of seconds and then walk the hands and legs down the wall again, taking care to keep the arms and legs and torso as rigid and straight as possible. You should be aiming to hold the position as long as possible.

> # 5.2 FREESTANDING HANDSTAND
> 
>  
> 
> Once you have spent some time getting used to being inverted using the wall walks, you will want to start learning how to progress towards a freestanding handstand. This, is the name suggests, is where you perform a handstand with no support at all, using your fingers, hands, arms and shoulders to balance in one place. This is as much a strength exercise as it is a skill, so to progress you will need to put in the practice time. Nevertheless, achieving a proper freestanding handstand is a vital stage of your calisthenics training, and is well worth the time investment.
> 
>  
> 
> The freestanding handstand is best learnt in stages, and these are detailed in this section. The stages are as follows:
> 
>  
> 
> Firstly, a wall supported handstand, where the hands are placed on the floor and the feet are supported by a wall. The will teach you how to start balancing using the fingertips and the elbow and shoulder joints to control the rest of the body. It will also expose you to kicking up into a handstand in the first place.
> 
>  
> 
> Secondly, recovering from a handstand that has gone wrong. This is a vital stage and is essential for building the confidence for further handstand work.
> 
>  
> 
> Thirdly, a handstand performed on the floor. This stage will show you how to balance using the finger tips, hands, and the elbows and shoulders to manipulate the body and maintain the handstand.
> 
>  
> 
> Lastly, a handstand performed using parallets. This stage will show you how to use parallets to balance with, including using the apparatus to its advantage, and the pros and cons to using equipment for the handstand.

> # 5.2.1 WALL SUPPORTED HANDSTAND
> 
>  
> 
> The first stage in learning how to perform a free balancing handstand is the wall supported variation. As the name suggests, this version allows the feet to rest on a wall so that you do not have to worry about tipping over. This is the most common concern for the majority of people when they start their handstand training, as going over onto your back makes you feel like you have no control over the situation at all, and it can be very hard to build confidence again if this does happen. Simply put, if you overbalance onto your back your feet will simply hit the wall and you can start again. Secondly, if you under balance onto your front, you can kick up to a wall handstand and start again.
> 
>  
> 
> The other main part to this exercise is that of kicking up into a handstand in the first place. This can be a problem for many people, but if you follow the instructions laid out in this section then you should not have too many difficulties.
> 
>  
> 
> This exercise is divided into two separate parts, which are kicking up into the handstand and learning how to balance.

> # WALL SUPPORTED HANDSTAND – KICKING UP
> 
>  
> 
> 1\. To perform the wall handstand place your hands on the floor about a foot away from the wall you are using. The hands should be about shoulder width apart with the fingers spread out in a wide span.
> 
>  
> 
> 2\. Position your feet in the following way; one tucked up close to your chest, and the other stretched out behind you. Which way round you do this is entirely down to personal preference. Some people prefer to have the right foot forward and the left foot back, and others prefer the opposite. Experiment with both to find which is the one for you.
> 
>  
> 
> 3\. From here, kick up into the air with your rear leg. Try and keep it as straight as possible. Make sure that you keep your arms locked out and your core as tight as you can.
> 
>  
> 
> 4\. As your rear leg travels into the air, follow it with the front leg. At first only kick up a small amount, just so that you can get comfortable with the movement. As you get more confident, start to kick up harder and harder until your body starts to become a little more vertical.
> 
>  
> 
> 5\. Once you start to get vertical, allow your legs to keep moving and they will hit the wall. This stage will no doubt be nerve wracking the first time you do it, but keep sticking at it.
> 
>  
> 
> 6\. Once your feet are on the wall simply hold the position as long as possible.
> 
>  
> 
> 7\. Once you are ready to come down, keep the arms locked and allow one leg to drop before the other. Try and control the descent as much as possible, as this will also build strength and control.

> # WALL SUPPORTED HANDSTAND - BALANCING
> 
>  
> 
> The second part of this section is learning how to balance. This is another very important stage and must be practiced a lot to see improvement and progress. At first you will only be able to balance for a very short time, maybe a couple of seconds or so, but this will slowly improve and after a few weeks or months you will be balancing for longer and longer periods.
> 
>  
> 
> 1\. To learn how to balance, kick up into a wall handstand and get comfortable.
> 
>  
> 
> 2\. From here, push down with your fingertips as hard as you possibly can. You should be aiming to get your feet to come away from the wall. If pushing down with your fingertips does not move your feet off the wall, try kicking off the wall with your feet very softly.
> 
>  
> 
> 3\. As soon as your feet come away from the wall try and balance for as long as you can. To correct overbalance (onto your back) push down hard with your fingertips. To correct under-balance (down onto your front) bend your elbows slightly, and try and manipulate your shoulders. If at any point your feet hit the wall, then push back off and try again. If you under balance and land on your feet, then simply kick back up into a handstand again.
> 
>  
> 
> 4\. Practice as long as you are able to. When your shoulders and upper body become too fatigued, take a rest and then perform another set.

> # 5.2.2 RECOVERING FROM A HANDSTAND
> 
>  
> 
> Once you have gotten some confidence kicking up into a handstand and resting your feet against a wall, and you have generated some strength in the hands and fingers and can balance a little, then it is time to start trying to kick up into a handstand without a wall to catch you. This can be daunting at first as the vast majority of people are scared of falling onto their backs and hurting themselves. To avoid this, you need to learn how to recover from a handstand. Once you have followed the instructions that come next, make sure you practice recovering. This will give you much more confidence when it comes to actually performing freestanding handstands.
> 
>  
> 
> 1\. To learn how to recover from a handstand, find a clear space that has no obstacles that you may hit or run into. Now kick up into a handstand.
> 
>  
> 
> 2\. As you feel your legs going over your head, as if you are going to overbalance, take one hand off the floor. It is likely that you will have a preferred side for this. For example, I always take my left hand off of the floor when recovering from a handstand.
> 
>  
> 
> 3\. Taking your hand off the floor will make your body pivot around the hand that is still in contact with the floor, and your legs should come round at the same time.
> 
>  
> 
> 4\. Then simply place your feet on the floor and recover from the handstand. Keep practicing this until you get completely comfortable doing this. You need to be confident that every time that you overbalance you can recover.

> # 5.2.3 FLOOR HANDSTAND
> 
>  
> 
> Once you have gotten some experience with wall handstands and you can recover from a handstand with confidence, it will be time to start kicking up into a handstand and trying to balance without a wall for support. There are two different types of freestanding handstands we are going to look at in this section, which are using the floor and using parallets. The first one we will look is the one with the hands on the floor.
> 
>  
> 
> 1\. To perform a freestanding handstand kick up into a handstand.
> 
>  
> 
> 2\. As your legs come over your head push down hard with your fingertips to stop yourself from overbalancing.
> 
>  
> 
> 3\. Now try and hold the handstand as long as you can. To correct overbalance (onto your back) push down hard with your fingertips. To correct under-balance (down onto your front) bend your elbows slightly. Also try and point your toes as much as possible, as this can help with alignment and generating tension throughout the rest of the body. In terms of the legs, you can either press them together or hold them in a straddle “V” position. Experiment with both to find your favourite.
> 
>  
> 
> 4\. Try and hold the handstand for a set amount of time, such as 2 to 3 seconds to begin with. Slowly you will get better and your hold times will increase.

> # HANDSTAND
> 
>  
> 
> The third type of free balancing handstand is performed on parallets. I find this variation somewhat easier than when performed on the floor, as the use of the parallets allows your hands to both pull and push, making balancing slightly easier in most cases. You will still need to practice to achieve proficiency here. There is also the added factor that parallets will be a little higher, which means that when you recover you will be a little higher off the ground, which can be an issue for some people.
> 
>  
> 
> 1\. To perform the freestanding handstand on parallets, position your parallets about shoulder width apart and place your hands on them.
> 
>  
> 
> 2\. Kick up into a handstand. As your legs come over your head push down hard with your hands to stop yourself from overbalancing.
> 
>  
> 
> 3\. Now try and hold the handstand as long as you can. To correct overbalance (onto your back) push down hard with your hands. To correct under-balance (down onto your front) pull hard with your hands and/or bend your elbows slightly. Also try and point your toes as much as possible, as this can help with alignment and generating tension throughout the rest of the body. In terms of the legs, you can either press them together or hold them in a straddle “V” position. Experiment with both to find your favourite.

> 4\. Try and hold the handstand for a set amount of time, such as 2 to 3 seconds to begin with. Slowly you will get better and your hold times will increase
