**Description**: **The founder and CEO of AppSumo.com, Noah Kagan, knows how to launch a seven-figure business in a single weekend—and he’s done it seven times. <i>Million Dollar Weekend </i>will show you how.**  
Now is the best time in history for entrepreneurship. More than ever, the world needs new businesses and it’s cheaper than ever to create them.  
And, let’s be frank: most day jobs suck. People spend too much time doing too much work for too little money—and they know it. They want out.  
But, if the barriers to starting a business are getting lower and lower, why is it SO HARD TO DO for SO MANY PEOPLE? Why are there so many wantrepreneurs playing at business on social media and so few entrepreneurs actually running them?   
Ask yourself:   
11. Do you want to work for yourself, or start a side-hustle, but it all feels too risky and unpredictable?

> Leverage the Million Dollar Weekend process (chapter 5) in the early mornings, evenings, and weekends. Once you’ve validated an idea, and you’re pulling in enough to cover your minimum monthly expenses—aka the Freedom Number—then you can quit. I’ve done that twice.

### Chapter 1: Just Fu**ing Start

[[BookFusion/Books/Million Dollar Weekend-5268557|Million Dollar Weekend]]

> ### CHALLENGE
> 
> The Dollar Challenge.
> 
> **Ask someone you know for a dollar investment in you and your future business—one measly dollar!**
> 
> This is YOUR spark. Once you do this, you realize the power of starting and the simplicity of business: starting, asking, iterating. I’ve seen thousands of lives changed by this simple and powerful exercise.
> 
> Tell them in exchange, they’ll get regular updates and a front-row seat to the process of building a business from scratch, warts and all—like a member of your personal board of directors. Sure, it’s an insignificant amount, yet jumping right in and asking for it—from family, friends, colleagues—is an oh-shit starting-and-asking experience that will get your heart racing.
> 
> This is the script I’ve seen work best:
> 
> Hey \[first name\]
> 
> I’m reading this book *Million Dollar Weekend* and they told me I need to get $1 from someone.
> 
> You’re the first person I thought of, and it would mean a lot to have your support.
> 
> Can you send me $1 right now?
> 
> \[your name\]
> 
> *Oh no, I’m on the hook for this,* you’ll think. Good! Feel that fear and do it anyway. As my guy Ralph Waldo Emerson likes to say: “Do the thing you fear, and the death of fear is certain.”
> 
> Every day, people in my audience post pictures of their first dollar with pride. It’s a symbolic game-changer for anyone who’s been sitting on the sidelines wishing they had their own business. And while you’re at it, ask me, too! Here’s my venmo/cash app @noahkagan or paypal@okdork.com. I may even say yes.
> 
> **Post and tag me @noahkagan, #thedollarchallenge.** I may repost you.

> PRO TIP: Next time you are overthinking and not taking action, tell yourself to prioritize taking action NOW and don’t worry about the HOW. After you do this ONCE, you quickly get momentum and it becomes easier and more natural.

> Finally, my goal had a very specific number attached. And that focuses your mind on what matters in business, which are the things most likely to bring you customers. **Many struggle to make their first dollar because they are so focused on how to make their first million.** Focusing on an attainable Freedom Number—even better, just dollar number one—will change the way you think: What can YOU do in your business to make money this week? Today? *Right now?*
> 
> You may not need a grand purpose to start (though if you have one, awesome!), but it’s also true that **if you commit to nothing, you’ll be distracted by everything**. The Freedom Number helps us not get lost in abstraction or complexity; it reminds us the mechanics of business are simple

> Choosing your Freedom Number.
> 
> Start by choosing a short-term monthly revenue goal—your Freedom Number—and make it a number that doesn’t scare you. **Write it down in your journal and here in this book, right next to these words.**
> 
> **My Freedom Number is:**
> 
> This chapter can be summarized in one sentence: *Successful people just start.*
> 
> I promise you: Who you are, what you have, and what you know right now are more than enough to get going

### Chapter 2: The Unlimited Upside of Asking

[[BookFusion/Books/Million Dollar Weekend-5268557|Million Dollar Weekend]]

> **The thing is, most people don’t ask for what they want. They wish for it, they make “suggestions” and drop hints, they hope. But the simple fact of business is that only by asking do you receive what you want. No ASK? No GET. That applies to every part of life. Seriously, every part**
