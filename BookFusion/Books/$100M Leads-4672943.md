**Description**: **You can get 2x, 10x, or 100x more leads than you currently are without changing anything about what you sell...**

This book contains the playbooks that took me from sleeping on my gym floor to owning a portfolio of companies that generate $200,000,000 per year in under a decade. Wanna know the biggest difference between those two time periods? How many leads I was getting.

The problem is - most business owners don\'t know how to get leads.



**I wrote this book to solve your LEADS problem.**

Today, our companies generate 20,000+ new leads per day across sixteen different industries. And, they do it using the eight \"never-go-hungry\" playbooks inside. Once you see them, you can\'t unsee them. They\'re so powerful, they work without your permission.

Inside you will find...

...The easiest way to get another five customers tomorrow

...The hook-retain-reward system to transforms content into...

> You have to sell stuff to make money. It seems simple enough, but everyone tries to skip to the ‘make money’ part. It doesn’t work. I tried. You need all the pieces. You need the stuff to sell - an offer. You need people to sell it to - leads. Then you gotta get those people to buy it - sales. Once you put all those in place, then you can make money.

### Engage Your Leads: Offers and Lead Magnets

> Offers are what you promise to give in exchange for something of value. Often, a business promises to give its product or service in exchange for money. This is a core offer. If you advertise your core offer, then you go straight for the sale–the direct path to money. Advertising your core offer might be all you need to get leads to engage. Try this way first.

[[BookFusion/Books/$100M Leads-4672943|$100M Leads]]

> Sometimes, though, people want to know more about your offer before they buy. This is common for businesses that sell more expensive stuff. If that’s you, then you’ll often get more leads to engage by advertising with a lead magnet first. A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrow problem. It’s typically a lower-cost or free offer to see who is interested in your stuff. And, once solved, it reveals another problem solved by your core offer. This is important because leads interested in lower-cost or free offers now are more likely to buy a related higher-cost offer later.

> Think of it like salty pretzels at a bar. If somebody eats the pretzels, they’ll get thirsty and order a drink. The salty pretzels solve the narrow problem of hunger. They also reveal a thirst problem solved by a drink, which they can get, in exchange for money. The pretzels have a cost, but when done right, the drink revenue covers the cost of the pretzels and nets a profit.

> So your lead magnet should be valuable enough on its own that you could charge for it. And, after they get it, they should want more of what you offer. This gets them one step closer to buying your stuff. A person who pays with their time now is more likely to pay with their money later.

> Something to keep in mind before we start - Grand Slam Offers work for free stuff as much or better than they do for paid stuff. So make your lead magnet so insanely good people will feel stupid saying no. And yes, this means you may have a few insanely valuable offers (even if some are free). But that’s a good thing. The business that provides the most value wins. Period. So let’s get started

> We start by picking a problem that’s narrow and meaningful. Then, solve it. And, like we just learned, when we solve one problem, a new problem reveals itself. Here comes the important part- if we can solve that new problem with our core offer, we’ve got a winner. This is because we solve this new problem in exchange for money. That’s it. Don’t overthink it.

> Example: Imagine we help homeowners sell their homes. That is a broad solution. But what about the steps before selling a home? Owners want to know what their house is worth. They want to know how to increase its value. They need pictures. They need it cleaned. They need landscaping. They need minor things fixed. They need moving services. They may need staging. Etc. These are all narrow problems–great for lead magnets. We pick one of the narrow problems and solve it for free. And although it helps, it makes their other problem more obvious–they still have to sell their home. But now we’ve earned their trust. So we can charge to solve the remaining problems with our core offer and help them achieve their broader goal

> First, if your audience has a problem they don’t know about, your lead magnet would make them aware of it. Second, you could solve a recurring problem for a short amount of time with a sample or trial of your core offer. Third, you can give them one step in a multi-step process that solves a bigger problem. All three solve one problem and reveal others. So your three types are: 1) Reveal Problems, 2) Samples and Trials, and 3) One Step Of A Multi-Step Process.

There’s always a way, and this is one of the highest leverage things you can do with your time - make sure how you package it gets engagement and you give yourself a big head start.

A Call To Action (CTA) tells the audience what to do next. But, there’s a little more to it than that. At least, if you want your advertising to work. Good CTAs have two things: 1) what to do and 2) reasons to do it right now.

And second, any reason (even bad ones) tends to work better than no reason at all. So to get more people to take action, I include as many effective reasons as I can. Here are my favorite reasons to act now

%%end-highlight-2020844%%

%%begin-highlight-2020845%%
[[BookFusion/Books/$100M Leads-4672943|$100M Leads]]

> a) Scarcity- Scarcity is when there is a limited amount of something. Especially when there is a small supply compared to demand. When something is scarce, like your lead magnet or offer, people also tend to want it more. And this is why they’re more likely to act right now. The fewer you have, the more valuable people think it is. But there’s a catch- the fewer you have, the fewer engaged leads you can get before running out. So the best strategy I know for scarcity is - reality. Let me explain. If you sold 1000x the customers tomorrow, could you handle it? If not, you have some limit to how much you can sell. Maybe you’re limited by customer service, onboarding, inventory, time slots per week, etc. Don’t keep it a secret - advertise it. This gives you ethical scarcity. If you can’t handle more than five new customers per week, say so. Draw attention to the natural scarcity in your business. If you have limitations you may as well use them to make money

> b) Urgency. You can have unlimited units to sell, but let’s say you stop selling them in an hour… on purpose. I bet more people than normal will buy your thing in that hour. This is urgency in action. Urgency is when people act faster because they have a short amount of time. And the less time people have, the faster (more urgent) they tend to act. So if you make the time they can act on your CTA shorter, you can get more of them to act on it faster. You can also use the same urgency with discounts or bonuses that go away after X minutes or hours. After which, this offer will never be available again.

> Now, let’s say one out of ten folks who get the lead magnet buys your core offer. This means your new cost to acquire a customer is $1000 ($100 x 10 people). We just cut our cost to get a customer by 3x. So instead of spending $3000 to get a new customer, by using a lead magnet, we spend only $1000. Given we make $10,000, that’s a 10:1 return. So if we keep our advertising budget the same, and use a lead magnet, we triple our business. Remember: the goal is to print money, not just make our “fair share.”

> We can contact people 1-to-1 or 1-to-many. Another way of thinking about this is private or public communication. Private communication is when only one person gets a message at a time. Think “phone call” or “email.” If you announce something publicly, many people can get it at the same time. Think “social media posts” or “billboards” or “podcasts.

But, we let them connect the dots. Since you didn’t ask them to buy anything, you don’t come off as pushy. Some people will show interest in your stuff. Some will refer you to those who might.

> Often, the most expensive part of what you sell isn’t the price–it\'s the hidden costs. Hidden costs are the time, effort, and sacrifice it takes to get results from the thing you sell. In other words, the bottom part of the value equation. If you struggle to give your stuff away for free, it means either people don’t want it (dream outcome), they don’t believe you (perceived likelihood of achievement) or the hidden costs (time, effort and sacrifice) are too high. In short, your ‘free’ stuff is too expensive. So figure out the hidden costs. Once you do, you unlock even more value–that you’ll eventually be able to charge for.

The effectiveness of your hook is measured by the percentage of people who start consuming your content. So if you hook attention well, many people will have a reason to consume your content. If you do a poor job, few people will have a reason to consume your content. Remember, this is a competition for attention. We have to beat every alternative they have to win theirs.

I divide topics into five categories: Far Past, Recent Past, Present, Trending, and Manufactured.

If you have relevant commentary or it touches your expertise in some way, talk about it. Talking about trendy stuff is very effective for gaining the attention of a broader audience.

This costs the most time and effort since you have to create the experience versus talking about one you already had. But, it can have the biggest payouts.

> Thankfully, the give : ask ratio has been well-studied. Television averages 13 minutes of advertising per 60 minutes of air time. That means 47 min are dedicated to ‘giving,’ and 13 min are dedicated to ‘asking’. That’s roughly a 3.5:1 ratio of giving to asking. On Facebook, it’s roughly 4 content posts for every 1 ad on the newsfeed. This gives us an idea of the minimum give : ask ratio we can sustain. After all, television and Facebook are mature platforms. They care less about growing their audiences and care more about making money from them. So they give less and ask more. Which means “give, give, give, ask” is the ratio that gets us closer to maximally monetizing an audience without shrinking it. But, most of us want to grow, so we shouldn’t model them. We should model growing platforms.

Go to my site to grab a pretty visual of them.” And as long as I have an audience that wants to get more leads, this will get some of them to engage. Then, the thank you page after the opt-in page for my lead magnet would display my paid offer with some video explaining how it works. Bonus points if your lead magnet is relevant to your content advertising it.

Then, if the contact information is up to date, the leads are responsive, and they are the type of person the software claims them to be, bingo! Then I get as many leads as the software will give me.

When I find people that meet my qualifications, I check to see if they have ways to contact them in the group’s directory–like links to their social media profiles, etc. If they do, I add them to my list. If they don’t, I can reach out to them within the platform hosting the group. I prefer to find contact information outside the group so I don’t come off as someone solely trying to milk the group for business but I will if I have to.

But if you assemble a list of names yourself, it’s less likely that person has already received many cold reach outs from other companies. So they’re the freshest. Downside: it takes the most time. Of course, you can pay someone else to do this for you once you figure it out for yourself, but we’re only talking about getting started in this chapter. We’ll talk about scaling in Section IV

> a) Automated Delivery. To the extent that we can, automating delivery unlocks huge scale as someone doesn’t need to literally communicate the message to the prospect. This means you get more engaged leads per unit of time (even if fewer engage by overall percentage). Remember, you have far more people who don’t know you than people who do. So you don’t have to worry as much about ‘burning through an audience.’

>  
> 
> Let’s say I make a personal video or record a personal voice memo for one hundred people. I say their name and add one personal line before delivering my standard message. From there, twenty percent of people reply. We now have twenty engaged leads. From there we use the same A-C-A format from the warm outreach section to qualify them for a call and so forth. So like the phone example, you know you do well when the cost of doing cold outreach is less than three times what you make in profit from a customer. Note: You can do WAY better than three times, that’s the bare minimum. For context, the portfolio company above gets over 30:1 returns from its outreach efforts.

Targeting options include: age, income, gender, interests, time, location, etc. For example, if you know no one over forty-five or below twenty-five has ever bought your thing, then exclude anyone outside that range. If you sell car parts then show your ad during car shows and on car channels. If only people with pets buy your thing, then include pets as an interest. Basic filters on top of the platform-generated lookalike audience are a simple way to get more of the right people to see your ads. End result: more efficient ads.

Eventually, you’ll have a list of people that engaged with your paid ads by giving you contact information but didn’t buy. That’ll come in handy. Then, if the platform allows, use these lists in order of quality to create your lookalike audience. Then, if the platform also allows, add filters on top of your lookalike audience to target an even higher percentage of people to engage with your ad. If you are incapable of making a lookalike audience, then simply start by targeting interests.

So if you serve a broad customer base use more ethnicities, ages, genders, personalities etc. in your ads. If you serve a narrow customer base (ex: medical devices for seniors), then use people who look like them.

So all you have to do is know eight key things about your own product or service: how it fulfills each element of value for your prospect, and how it helps them avoid their hidden costs (remember those?). Think of them like carrots vs sticks. How your offer delivers more good stuff and less bad stuff. Then think of the perspectives of the people who would experience them (Who). And finally, what time period (When) they’d have these experiences (positive or negative).

> What\'s a good LTGP to CAC ratio? Every business I invest in that struggles to scale has at least one thing in common - their LTGP to CAC ratio was less than 3 to 1. As soon as I get it above 3 to 1 (either through decreasing CAC or increasing LTGP), they take off. This is a pattern I personally observed, not a rule.

The money, systems, and experience you earned from the prior method will help you master the next. A business that posts free content and runs paid ads will get more out of their ads and their content than a business that does only one or the other. A business that does cold outreach and makes content will get more from their cold outreach and work their warm leads better than one that does only one.

> 
> 1.  If I have seven small things to deliver, I deliver them at shorter intervals rather than all at once.
> ^
> 
> 1.  Updates are wins. If it’s a bigger project, I share progress updates as frequently as possible. You can never give someone too much good news. And regular updates, progress or not, is better than leaving your customers hanging.
> ^
> 
> 1.  Customers form their lasting impression of a business within the first forty-eight hours after they buy. Force a good impression. Force as many wins as you can in that window. Set many expectations. Meet many expectations. Repeat.
> ^
> 
> 1.  They should always know the next time they’ll hear from you. I got a slick saying from a public CEO friend of mine - BAMFAM: Book-A-Meeting-From-A-Meeting. Again, never leave a customer in no man’s land. They should always know what happens…next.
> ^
> 
> 1.  Never expect customers to forgive you. Ever. So act like it. For example, you can deliver early, but never late. I add fifty percent to my timelines so I always deliver early. That makes “on time” for me early for them.

You can ethically charge a different price for the same thing because you changed the terms of the sale.

> Step One - Document. You make a checklist. You already know how to do the thing. Now you just need to write down the steps exactly as you do it. You can also have other trusted observers watch you and document what you do. Bonus points if you record yourself doing the thing multiple ways and in multiple shifts. This way, you can watch yourself as an observer rather than breaking your flow by pausing to take notes while you go. Once you’ve got everything put into the checklist, bust it out on your next work block and only follow those steps. Can you do an A+ job only following your directions exactly? If you can, you have the first draft of your checklist for the job.

> Step Two - Demonstrate: You do it in front of them. Just like your parents taught you how to tie your shoes. You sit down and walk them through the checklist step by step. This may take a while depending on how many steps it takes to complete the thing. If they stop you, or slow you down to understand something, adjust your checklist for that. Now you have the second draft ready for them to try.

We just want them to duplicate what we did. So if the checklist is right, the outcome will be the same. And if the checklist is off–you’ll find out fast! Fix your checklist until it’s right. Then, have them follow it until they get it right. And once they nail it, you now have a bonafide lead-getter on your payroll. Congratulations!

> 1.  A helpful way to look at this training style is: If they get it wrong or get confused then we got it wrong or made it confusing. If we have to explain what a step means then the step is too complicated. Or, more likely, we tried to put multiple steps into one.

> 1.  If they only appear to “get it” after a longish explanation or multiple demonstrations then, again, we’ve got some work to do. Business owners that ignore this run into chronic training problems. And, word to the wise, you can probably force an inferior checklist to work, but this turns into a nightmare when somebody else takes over your training for you.

> There is a difference between competence and performance. In other words, they can know exactly what to do and not be that good at it yet. If that’s the case, then your instructions are fine and they just need practice. Using an analogy from the fitness world–think “slow then smooth then fast.” You don’t need to change anything, they just need more reps

> Focus on your employee’s ability to follow directions more than whether they get the right result. This is super important because if you train your employees to follow directions then… they will follow directions. And, if they follow directions and get the wrong result… then you know it’s the directions. That’s good. You have a lot more control over that.

Instead of offering your product, you offer a fast, simple, and easy way to make commissions promoting it. And that can mean literally millions of engaged leads to your business.

Every time I create a new affiliate “hit list” I start with these categories. Note: If you find a business that falls into multiple categories, there’s a high chance they’ve got lots of good leads for you and that they’d make a great affiliate.

> Way #1: Make Them A Customer: Make them buy and preferably use the product to keep affiliate status. This is the lowest barrier investment that’s worked for me. I’ve found the more money an affiliate invests in your product, the more money they make. This should make sense. If they don’t believe in your stuff enough to buy it, they probably shouldn’t sell it. You can tell them I said so.

> Way #2: Make Them An Expert: I make them pay for the onboarding and training that certifies them as a product expert. If you have them buy a product to become an affiliate, you can have them use that as credit towards a certification. As in, the certification comes with the products they bought. Now, aside from actually making the affiliate useful, certifying them does two things. First, it covers some of the costs of advertising. Second, it means I can afford proper onboarding and training of every. single. affiliate.

So if your average affiliate makes $40,000 per year selling your stuff, then charge $4000-$8000 to onboard and train them. Too low, and you won’t get them invested. Too high and you won’t get enough affiliates. I found 10-20% maximizes the number of people who become active affiliates

> Affiliates advertise your lead magnet or core offer to their audience before they can buy it. They post. They do warm outreach. They run paid ads. They may even do cold outreach. They do as much advertising as they can until the day of launch. When the product is available, they sell it to all the engaged leads they assembled. Some sell one-on-one, some pitch to the whole group. And others simply make the product available.

> If you have something in the works, you can start the whisper phase a few years out. The further out you start whispering, the bigger deal it becomes to your audience. We start this early because, the longer something appears to take, the more an audience will value it. For example, all other things being equal, an audience will value a product that took ten years to make more than one that took ten days. So - show your work.
>

> Remember: curiosity comes from wanting to know what happens next. So embed questions about the product in their minds. We need to tell them about something they want to know more about, then say…not yet.

> 1) Affiliates Give Your Lead Magnet Away When Somebody Buys Their Stuff. The idea here is for your lead magnet to make the affiliate’s offer more valuable. This allows them to charge more for it and get more leads than they could without it. Remember, the best lead magnets give away a free trial or sample of your thing, reveal a problem, or offer a single step of a multi-step solution. Here are examples of each:
> 
> Samples And Trials: Say I sell massages and recruit the personal training studio next door as an affiliate. Now, everyone who buys personal training from them gets a free massage from me. The personal training studio now has a stronger offer they can charge more for and we get more massage leads. Everybody wins.

> Reveal a Problem: Instead of giving a free massage, we offer a free or discounted posture assessment with every training package they sell. Assessments and discounts add less value to the affiliate’s offer, but some people will still do it. And to be clear, after assessing the customer, you make them an offer to solve the problems you revealed.

> One Step In A Multi-Step Process: Say you have a three-part treatment plan. Massage, stretching, and adjustments. People getting enough value from one step will fear missing out on the rest of the steps. So the more they think the other steps will help solve their larger problem, the more likely they are to buy them. Your affiliate would give away step one of your multi-step process for free. You’d upsell the leads from there.

> 2) Affiliates Sell Your Lead Magnet. Basically, the affiliate can sell anything of yours that turns their customers into your customers. It could be a book, an event, a service, software, a sample product, etc. Also, giving affiliates all the cash from selling a lead magnet you fulfill becomes all profit and no work for them–an attractive proposition for any business. Your money comes by selling your main thing for more than it cost you to deliver your lead magnet. And if you do it this way, you don\'t need to split any money with them on your core offer. Another win-win.
> 
> Example: They sell each of those things we gave away for free in the step above. They sell your massage at a discounted price. They sell your assessment (which you could do 1-1 or in a group format like a workshop). They sell part one of your multi-step solution.

The way you do business, your leadership, and the value of your product all come into play. You are only as good as the goodwill you have with your affiliate partners. Arrange it right and you should both be better off from the relationship. They should be able to spend more to acquire customers through a more compelling offer, higher profits, or both.

> We do the core four to get engaged leads: warm outreach, post content, cold outreach, and paid ads. And we use them to get two types of engaged leads: the ones that become customers, or the ones we turn into lead getters. Lead getters come in four flavors: Referrers, Employees, Agencies, and Affiliates. Each have key strengths:
> 
>  
> 
> 1.  Customer referrals have the biggest potential for low-cost exponential growth.
> ^
> 
> 1.  Employees have your direct influence and run your business on your behalf.
> ^
> 
> 1.  Agencies teach skills you keep forever and can transfer to your team.
> ^
> 
> 1.  Affiliates, once you get them going, can operate entirely on their own

So it means you unlock a whole new level of effort you never even realized you had. It might mean only doing something fifty times to get the desired result. Or, like the flyers, five thousand times, every day, for years.

### The Roadmap - Putting it All Together

[[BookFusion/Books/$100M Leads-4672943|$100M Leads]]

> Level 1: Your friends know about the stuff you sell. To start getting engaged leads, you make one offer, to one avatar, on one platform. The moment you get engaged leads, is the moment you can start making money. For me, this started with reaching out to everyone I knew

%%begin-highlight-2095079%%
[[BookFusion/Books/$100M Leads-4672943|$100M Leads]]

> Level 2: You consistently let everyone you know about the stuff you sell. You know the exact inputs to get an engaged lead with your chosen advertising method. And, by scaling those inputs, you get consistent customers with it. But the consistent customers come from maximizing your personal work capacity. For me, on top of warm reach outs, I maximized my personal work capacity with paid aids, using a case study as my lead magnet. But looking back, I wish I would have started with posting free content. So I suggest that

> Primary Actions: Do as much warm outreach and post as much content as you can consistently.

Doing more. For me, I hired a videographer and a media buyer to take most of the paid ads work off my plate.

> Level 4: Your product is good enough to get consistent referrals. You continue building goodwill and shoot for getting 25% or more of your customers from referrals. Now, you’ve set yourself up to ramp your advertising again. But to make that work, you have to get more serious about hiring a team to make it happen.
