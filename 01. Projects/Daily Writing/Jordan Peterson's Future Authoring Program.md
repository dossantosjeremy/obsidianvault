# Instructions
The full future authoring exercise has 2 different stages, each with a number of steps.

- In Stage 1, you will write generally about your goals.
- In Stage 2, you will specify and clarify the nature of those goals, and begin to strategize.

We recommend that you complete the process over two or more separate days. People who allow themselves some time to sleep when they are making important decisions appear to do a better job and to benefit more. The entire exercise will require approximately two and a half hours.

On the first day, you might want to complete Stage 1.

On the second day, you could complete Stage 2.

You will need to concentrate and process what you are writing, so try to complete this exercise when you are feeling alert and relatively unrushed. Simply follow the on-screen instructions as you go along. If you need to take a short break or two of 5-10 minutes to get up and walk around during the process, please feel free to do so.

You will be asked to write down your private thoughts and feelings. Please type them directly into the box provided. At times, you may be asked to write non-stop, without regard for grammar or spelling. At other times, you may be asked to revise what you have written.

This exercise is meant to benefit YOU personally. Everything you write will remain accessible only to you and those you designate as recipients. The report you produce will summarize your personal goals and strategies. You and your recipients, if any, will be emailed a copy of this report shortly after you complete the exercise.

During some sections, you will be asked to write for specified amounts of time. Please try your best to write for the amount of time specified (so, if it asks you to write for 1-2 minutes, please write continuously for at least 60 seconds).

During this exercise, you will be presented with a series of pages either providing you with information, or asking you to describe aspects of your personality and experiences.

# **The Ideal Future: Preliminary Notes and Thoughts**

In this exercise you will begin to create a version, in writing, of your ideal future. William James, the great American psychologist, once remarked that he did not know what he thought until he had written his thoughts down. When he didn't know what to write, he wrote about anything that came to mind. Eventually, his ideas became focused and clarified.

Brainstorm. Write whatever comes to mind. Don't worry too much about sentence construction, spelling, or grammar. There will be plenty of time to write polished sentences later. Avoid criticizing what you write. Premature criticism interferes with the creative process.

# **Imagining Your Ideal Future**

You will start with some exercises of imagination that will help you warm up to the task of defining your future.

These will include 8 questions such asâ€¦

- "what could you do better?"
- "what would you like to learn about?"
- "what habits would you like to improve?"

After briefly answering these 8 questions, you will be asked to write for 15 minutes about your ideal future, without editing or criticism.

Let yourself daydream or fantasize. You are trying to put yourself into a state of reverie, which is a form of dream-like thinking that relies heavily on internal imagery. This kind of thinking allows all your different internal states of motivation and emotion to find their voice.

It might be best to concentrate on your future three to five years down the road, although you may have reasons to concentrate on a shorter or longer timespan (eighteen months to ten years).
