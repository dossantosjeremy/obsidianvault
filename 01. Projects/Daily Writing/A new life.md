[[A New Life - Version 2]]



# The why
I am 32. I decided I need to work actively on improving my life each day. 

There are several ways I identified how I could improve my life. All of them point to the same mindset, which is the one I currently have: Experience Design, or XD. 

How does experience design works

Other theories and frameworks that you can apply to improve your life, step by step. 

# Lectures, in order

# The risk
The only downside of my approach, I think is that as I am an impatient person, I would expect this to last a minimum amount of time and like everything of value in life, it will take time. So I do not expect this process to be finished anytime soon. 

# Why is it so important
* Companies spend X amount of money each week / month / year for this. 
* They hire project managers, consultants, strategists... 
* In fact, this has been described by the Harvard business review as being adapted from the world of entreprise
* If there is one single thing that should be most important to you, this would be your life. 
* So, anything that is important to you would deserve your attention, and attention would precede intention. You need to conduct things with intent. 
* To do that, we need to have a vision and to think strategically. 

# The theories
20. Take the parallel of design thinking theory
	1. 5 whys
	2. Interviews to yourself
	3. Journey
	4. Pain points
	5. Ideation
21. Thinking in systems or habits
22. The theory of constraints (or bottleneck thinking) / Nick Saraev Media

[A comprehensive audit of my lifestyle](https://nicksaraev.com/lifestyle-audit/)

Choice architecture: The idea that your environment shapes your decisions and influences your likelihood of performing a given behavior. 

We can imagine the likelihood of doing a behavior as a result of how easy it is for you to do it, or as the opposite of the friction for you to do it. 

This is the essence of the book by James Clear: design your environment so that you make the behaviors you want to do easier to perform, and the ones you want to stop harder. 
- E.g. buying groceries and cooking
- E.g. going to the gym
- E.g. sleeping 8 hours 

23. First, examine the current and identify some friction points
24. Then, associate to each friction point potential actions you can take to address that friction point, make positive actions easier to maintain and negative actions easier to discard
25. Prioritise these actions
26. Start from the least difficult

27. Take a notebook, spreadsheet... 
28. Go through the prompts that are meant to help you 
29. Give yourself a timer for each

## Sort all of these points of friction
* Sort them by difficulty
* Give them a rating, and sort them according to the result of the rating

[[Jordan Peterson's Future Authoring Program]] 
30. Write generally about your goals
31. Specify and clarify the nature of those goals, and begin to strategize
- Jordan recommends to let yourself some day in between the first and second step because, after all, these are important decisions. 
- It is best if you feel alert and relatively unrushed. 
- You are asked to write down your private thoughts and feelings. 

## Ideal future: Preliminary Notes and Thoughts
* Write freely without judging yourself. Ideas come to mind when they are not constrained by the criticism. 
* It starts with an exercise of imagination that helps warm up the task of defining the future
* E.g. 
	* What could you do better?
	* What would you like to learn about?
	* What habits would you like to improve?

## **Questions**
* What is one thing I can do better? 
* One thing I would like to improve?
* What habits do I want to improve?
* What is my social life in the future?
* My Leisure activity in the future?
* My Family life in the future?
* My career in the future?
* Qualities I admire
* My ideal future?
* A Future to avoid

## **Specific Goal** idenfication:
* Write about a theme or title to briefly describe your ideal future
* Inside, lay out your goals
* Then your future steps
* Then the extra






32. **This article by Harvard - strategic thinking**


**Strategically think about your life, from harvard**
* The article states that the day-to-day demands upon our life makes it difficult to pause and ponder about our future. 
* It also compares that to a corporate situation in which we would have no strategy and we know that this is not good for business. 
* The article states that it is oftentimes more difficult to come up with the right questions to orient ourselves than the right answers. That is why it is useful to remind the following questions to orient our lives, that are taken from corporate strategy
	* How do I define a great life?
	* What is my life purpose?
	* What is my life vision?
	* How do I assess my life portfolio?
	* What can I learn from benchmarks?
	* What portfolio choices can I make?
	* How can I ensure a successful, sustained life change?

* This is not new. Books such as https://designingyour.life/ would adapt concepts from design thinking and software development to help individuals. *
* Use the life strategy worksheet: https://hbr.org/resources/pdfs/big-idea-supplements/2023/12/HBR_My_Life_Strategy_Worksheet.pdf 
* These are the steps that the article goes through
	* 1. Defining what a great life means for you: Use each element of the PERMA-V and you can add other dimensions to it
		* Positive Emotions (frequent feelings of pleasure and contentment)
		* Engagement (Being in the flow, losing track of time)
		* Relationships (mutual feelings of caring, support and love)
		* Meaning (contributing the making the world a better place)
		* Achievement (success or mastery, reaching goals)
		* Vitality (Being Healthy and energetic)
		* Autonomy
		* Spirituality
		* Rate each one on a scale from 0 (not important) to 10 (very important)
		* Rate each one on a scale according to your satifaction (0 to 10)



	* 2. Outline your purpose: Determine 
		* What you are good at
		* What does the world need
		* What are your values (you can use some online lists to help you [lists](https://jamesclear.com/core-values))
		* What excites you
		* What need can I address in the world? (e.g. one of the 17 sustainable development goals: 17 [Sustainable Development Goals](https://www.undp.org/sustainable-development-goals) )
		* Ask friends and family, who would be your stakeholders, feedback. 
		* Use other methodologies: [other methods](https://hbr.org/2014/05/from-purpose-to-impact)
	* 3. Outline your life vision: 
		* What story would I like people to tell about me five to 10 years from now?
		* What would I do if money wasn’t an issue?
		* What will the 80-year-old me not want to have missed in life? 
	* 4. Portfolio analysis of how you spend your 168-hour week
		* Use analog tools to companies such as what BCG does to assess its portfolio: [2×2 growth-share matrix](https://www.bcg.com/about/overview/our-history/growth-share-matrix)
		* We will take the analog of a business unit in life. We will focus on six strategic life areas (SLAs)
			* Relationships
			* Body, Mind, Spirituality
			* Community and society
			* Job, learning and finances
			* Interests and entertainment
			* Personal care
		* We then subdivide the six SLAs into 16 strategic life units ![[Pasted image 20250122085157.png]]
		* Rate:
			* The time you spend in given areas
			* Your satisfaction
			* Rate how important they are to you*
		* Then plot the importance something has on an axis compare to your satisfaction. 
		* Look at your portfolio and define a high level plan for a better allocation of your energy, time and money. 


	* 5. Setting life-satisfaction benchmarks
	* 6. Incorporate the results of the first five steps, determine choices and changes in your life
	* 7. map out a plan for putting choices into action
Watch the [following video](https://hbr.org/2023/12/use-strategic-thinking-to-create-the-life-you-want) 

![[Pasted image 20250122085822.png]]
* Identify some models to you
	* Jocko Willings
	* Jordan Peterson
	* Cosmic Skeptic
	* Ellon Musk 
	* Jeff Bezos
	* etc.
* Studies have shown that the best predictors of life satisfaction include, unsurprisingly, health, significant others, children, friends, sports, spirituality and community involvement, as well as practicting kindness, mindfulness, meditation, gratefulnes, humor and laughter, dedicating time to learning and developing a growth mindset. 
* What is also imnportant is that your life strategy should only be yours. 
* As a takeaway:
	* Go back to step 1 and look for what you can do for your areas of dissatisfaction. 
	* - Review the vision from steps 2 and 3
- Determine how you might realize this vision
- Think about the SLUs from the portfolio exercise and how you can improve satisfaction or allocate more time. 
- Determine SOME changes to make, and select the ones that will best move you towards a great life, and commit to them. 
- At the same time, we have only 168 hours per week. we need to be smart with our time.
- Keep some hours for downtime. 
- Have in mind that some big changes can be triggered by small seemingly insignificant actions. 
- If you know which strategic life unit needs work but not what change to make, dig deeper and develop a strategy for that unit. 

* Use Objective and Key results framework. Associate each objective with key results, action items and deadlines. 
* Several strategies to hold ourselves to OKRs: Anchoring, e.g. sharing our plants. Consequences - e.g. rewards or punishment. Check-ins - stepping back, refining and adjusting the efforts and celebrating achievements. 
* Takeaway: To start, write down what defines a great life for you. Next, record your strengths, your values, what lights you up, and what the world needs, and then add your purpose statement that incorporates those ideas. Third, summarize your life vision. Fourth, refer to that 2×2 you sketched and note the SLUs that are high priorities for action or that you spend too much time on. Next, write down the changes you’d like to make and commit to. Finally, for each of those changes, list an objective and two to three key results with deadlines, and then note the anchors, the consequences, and the check-in plan to make the change stick.



33. The future authoring program by Jordan Peterson, probably combined to the past authoring program
34. Design thinking (identifying pain points and building around it)
35. Project management (e.g. planning, risk, setting goals...)
36. I also came across the idea of skill stacking. I think this is akin to the idea of cal newport called career capital. 

I love this article because for the first time it made me reminded me that life is not about maximising only one area. You can strive to improve in several fields. For instance: being good at socializing can be as important as going up the corporate ladder. 

37. The Kaisen philosophy
38. The Nick Saraev framework of friction and bottleneck thinking
39. Jordan Peterson's vision about sitting on the edge of your bed and thinking: What is one thing that I could do today, that I would do, that I will do?
40. Visualizing what you do not want to happen could also be beneficial, in 2 ways:
	1. If you do XYZ, what would happen? For instance, If I
	2. If you stay in your current situation, what would happen? E.g. If I do not learn new skills and I stay the same with my current skills, what would happen?
41. Also concentrate on
	1. IKIGAI
	2. What brings money to you, what generates money and if not, what puts you in the direction of mastery

For defining goals, there are several frameworks I have in mind:
42. The SMART framework
43. The OKR framework
44. My resources from O. to help me define my goals
At this time I am still not sure how they are different, albeit somewhat related. 

Then it is about decomposing a goal into several milestones (which will be significant accomplishments along the way). Then each milestones will be divided into tasks that are steps you should take to accomplish that milestone. Imagine milestones as mini-bosses you should win against in a video game and your goal is the final boss. 

I also know there are other theories telling you you should not set goals but systems, (like the atomic habits philosophy). I don't see them as exclusive. Like a lot of things in the world, I am not a fan of either-or mindset, black or white thinking. I think it is more complex than that. 

I think having a goal in mind, as small as it can be, will help you to see things clearly. You can define habits, but to what aim? You can say, I want to become a runner, so I will run every 3 days. That might work, but maybe not for everything. For instance, if you want to pass a project management certification, you need to define this goal in mind: I need to achieve X score at the project management certification. Then you define a system that will help you accomplish this goal. 

# Implementation

How would that work in practice? 

45. Identify areas of your life
	1. I would decompose the areas of my life in at least the following (see how Nick decomposes it, as well as Cal Newport)
		1. Financial
		2. Professional
		3. Skills
		4. Entertainment
		5. Friends and Family
		6. Constitution
46. For each area of your life, take note of where you think you are (HBR Guide)
47. You should also take note of the behaviors you are actually doing to help go in that direction
48. Then, take note of where you want to be
49. For that to be the case, what would need to happen?
50. At that step, you might not necessarily know what you should do to make it happen. It is highly probable that you need to make some kind of desk research, to define a curriculum of things you should do or learn. This was taught to me by the book "Ultralearning". 
51. What are the milestones I can define towards that goal?
52. What are the list of actions I should take to move towards that goal?
53. Choose a tool where all of this information should stay. Some people would say the choice of a tool is not important but I would tend to disagree. If the tool adds friction for you, you will end up not doing the behavior you are supposed to do. 

**The importance of planning**
* Here, using the system from Cal Newport to help in planning should help
	* https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/
	* https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-plan-your-week-in-advance/
54. Here, you need to implement a system of long and short term planning. I love the one made by Cal Newport. 

Example of implementation: 
* In a journal, have a column with your time blocks for the day, on one side of the journal. 
* Have a weekly and quarterly planning. 
* Dedicate 20 minutes each day to revise the weekly and quarterly planning notes. 
* Leave room on the right to make any changes. 
* Write details on the right column about what the events are going to be. 
* Periods of open-ended reactivity can also be blocked off like any other type of obligation. 
* Give open-ended blocks some secondary purposes (e.g. process clients requets)
* Read the book Daily Rituals by Mason Currey. 

Cal Newport Planning the week in advance
https://calnewport.com/deep-habits-plan-your-week-in-advance/
* Plan the week ahead the first day of the week
* Trying to match the time we have with the task at heand. 



55. What are the systems, habits and routines I can put in place to move towards that goal? 
56. What environment and lifestyle design change can I do to make it as easy as possible to adopt a new habit and as hard as possible to keep on with bad habits?

It seems I need to investigate a bit more on some resources.
