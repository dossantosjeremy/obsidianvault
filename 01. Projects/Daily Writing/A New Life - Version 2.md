**Personal motivation**
I am 32. I decided I need to work actively on improving my life each day. **Why?**

The motivation behind: I want to live a life that would be lived **intentionally**, meaning that it would be the result of me putting some thought into it. I do not want to live a life that is determined by everything else around me except me. 
I will not enter into the details of what I think about free will, but in a nutshell, I think that although our motivation, behaviours and actions are hugely determined by circomstances at any given time, in a way that we act most of the time in an automatic fashion, we can when given the opportunity, reflect on those occasions and plan, having these automations into consideration. 

There are several ways I identified how I could improve my life. All of them point to the same mindset, which is the one I currently have: Experience Design, or XD. 

I am hugely influenced by the experience design mindset, which states that a given product can be improved after successive iterations of research, design and evaluation. In this case, my life is the product, that I would conduct research on in order to improve it. 

In this article, I will share all the theories and strategies I came across that could help improve the quality of your life. 

**It is a skill worth using**
Planning, project management and strategy are important skills to have in today's world. The reason for that is, again, to live with intention. We can __ that with companies that spend a significant amount of their budget for that. They hire project managers, consultants, strategists... 

I started to think the other day: Wait, I am spending several times a week, several hours each day into planning the release of a product / managing a project. Of course, I am being paid for that, but am I putting the same amount of effort and thought into my life? However, what is most important to us that our lives? Anything that is important to you has your attention, and attention precedes intention. 

In order to conduct things with intent, we need a vision and to think strategically. 


**Routes for innovation**
In innovation, we have traditionally 2 ways to do it: 
* Incrementally, by improving a product a little bit every time. 
* In a disruptive fashion, by offering something completely different than the current experience. This is what was done with the iPhone for instance. 

Thing is, as with products, disruptive innovation can totally transform your life. I would make the hypothesis however than the cost you pay for that is a higher time of adaptation to this new way of life and potentially dropping out because it is being too different than your current way of life. Incremental innovation, applied to our life, would mean we improve the product, our life, incrementally. This is close to the Kaisen philosophy which I find attractive because it has some humble mindset associated to it. If the goal is to improve your life by 1% every time (define the timescale), that means you are setting objectives that are attainable, every time. So, you are being realistic. You are also trusting the process of the compounding interest of improving your life by 1% every time. Say you start at X. If you improve 1% each day during X time, your life would be better by X. 
On top of that, we all know it is best to set objectives and goals to ourselves that are realistic, attainable even though they seem small, to make sure you attain them.

2. **The Why**
   - Personal decision to improve life
   - Overview of Experience Design
   - Philosophies
	   - Kaizen: Being Better, 1% at a time
	   - Design Thinking

3. **The Risk**
   - Acknowledgment of impatience and time commitment

The only downside of my approach, I think is that as I am an impatient person, I would expect this to last a minimum amount of time and like everything of value in life, it will take time. So I do not expect this process to be finished anytime soon. 

4. **Why is it so Important**
   - Importance of strategic thinking and intent
   - Comparison to corporate strategies

Having a vision, a strategy and a plan is better than having none. Every time results are expected, strategies are put in place. Project, Program managers are hired in companies to do this exact job. When something is important, we dedicate some time to planning, forethought, thinking, and acting it out. Like Jordan Peterson said, thinking is no different than writing. So, I would say that to think about my life more clearly, I need to write it out.
