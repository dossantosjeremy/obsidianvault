|---|---|---|
|2|Foundational skills|Jeremy is really good at structuring research plans and setting the outcomes to develop a user centric culture. We’re growing on other foundational skills related to product thinking like having a holistic understanding of the product to have impact on backlogs and business decisions. To do this, we’re working on literature review with PMs and trying different activities to set up expectations with stakeholders and wrap up results in an agile way. In addition to this, we can work more on benchmark and competitive analysis to complement our findings.|
|3|Technical expertise|Jeremy manages all the methodologies that we use in the team, moving from qual to quant without issues. His plans and guides/questionnaires are solid and give useful information to the teams. From my POV, his areas of improvement are at the end of the workflow: we can work on reporting skills and product understanding in order to make recommendations. Also, we may use some other methodologies like first click tests when it’s necessary, just to make his toolbox bigger.|
|3|Soft skills|Jeremy is valued by his communication, ability to listen and to learn, and empathy to his colleagues and stakeholders. He frequently manages two parallel projects, and he gives visibility on weekly meetings, 121s and Jira/Confluence. Also, he follows all the steps suggested by the UXR WoW, having kick offs, setting expectations, giving visibility about the roadmap and the field work status, and sharing results. He’s able to establish strong|

relationships with his partners of design, data and product.  
The areas of improvement found are related to the estimations of efforts and the timeline setting, which make him work extra hours frequently.

Gas

- ●  “I think Gas is the only value where Jeremy needs to work on. He is a super contributor, but his care for every detail, his willingness to give his best and his desire to please every stakeholder make that he is not able to be "gas", having to even sacrifice his personal time at some point, which he shouldn't because it's important to have a balance. I really think that Jeremy should work on his prioritisation skills, try to be more "gas", and trust on himself to decide what can and should be done and what can't, being assertive in communicating with stakeholders and raise his voice when it becomes impossible. That would make him grow from to be an awesome contributor”
    
- ●  “Jérémy understand what needs to be prioritized, ambitious to deliver the best project. I like how he align teams to advance with the projects.”
    
- ●  “During our weekly meetings he came prepare and with a plan on how to tackle the most important tasks and actions. We also successfully worked together to define next steps”
    
- ●  “Jeremy works extremely hard to meet deadlines and never compromises on the quality of his work. This was very true of the Delivery Point issues project that we worked on where put in extra hours to make some last minute changes to the presentation.”
    
- ●  “Jeremy works with intensity and is very ambitious when it comes to give actionable insights. As an example I can mention the Courier Earnings project, where he did a really good job in the literature review, considering too many different sources of info and aligned several times with experienced stakeholders.”

Good Vibes

- ●  “Jeremy is super good vibes and it is a pleasure to be in his team, he is always positive, even when things don't go that well and has always nice words for everyone and willingness to help”
    
- ●  “Jérémy communicates with transparency and makes work fun, no matter what a difficult project, there is time to enjoy work. He is really positive even when some interviews had issues with the language, example french speakers in Morocco.”
    
- ●  “During our time working together there were times for both of us when we had different levels of workload or energy, but that was never negatively reflected on Jeremy's motivation or his
    

approach to our work or our communication”

- ●  “Jeremy is very friendly and in both of the projects we have worked in together, super
    
    collaborative. I have seen him stay very patient and understanding when stakeholders have put
    
    him under pressure. This is something I admire and value in a colleague. Well done Jeremy!”
    
- ●  “Jeremy is always looking for a positive and transparent working environment. Eg, when we talk about the on going Courier Earnings project, he appreciated my feedback and also shared with
    
    me the changes done considering those comments, which also helped me to understand better his ideas and what he was trying to get with the questions he was planning to do to our users.”

Stay humble

- ●  “Jeremy is always keen on receiving feedback and make sure he applies it. Sometimes he evn makes public some feedback that I share with him by private, making sure he won't forget about it. Also I think he is a humble contributor as he is always trying to learn from others best practices and even changing his ways of doing things and adapting when the sees a good practice, that makes him also very strong as he will always learn from the best practices of others.”
    
- ●  “Jérémy is always curious about how we work, and eager to listen our feedback. He created immediately a Miro to get opinions on the project he managed, so all stakeholders shared ideas to improve it. Most important is that he took these in consideration.”
    
- ●  “Jeremy proactively asked for feedback on his approach at different times”
    
- ●  “As someone who is relatively new to the company and gaining context every single day,
    
    Jeremy has embraced learning, admits gaps in his knowledge and seeks to plug them. He is also very independent, capable of finding information for himself and proactively seeks out feedback from others.”
    
- ●  “Jeremy is always open to learn and interested in his colleagues opinion. Eg, in the Courier Earnings project he not only asked for feedback, but also embraced the PM POV and her previous knowledge, and also invite the courier team during the process and in the presentation in order to listen to them and integrate their perceptions to the findings (even if they didn't agreed 100% with the qualitative findings that Jeremy had), adding granularity to the discoveries.”

0. Care
    
1. ●  “Jeremy is making sure he always gives feedback when others request it, and something that I really like is that he doesn't only focus on the things to improve, but also on the things that he thinks are good.”
    
2. ●  “Jérémy is always ready to listen and work together cocreating processes, for example the Best Practices in Maze. He cares about the rest to make everyone's included, so it impacts personally and professionally. I feel I have improved my job thanks to Jérémy, continuously sharing new ideas and proactively proposing ways to improve.”
    
3. ●  “When it was notified that Jeremy wouldn't be continuing as part of our team regarding the Collaboration OKR, he made sure to share as much information as possible when handing things off and he was available and attentive to make sure we gathered all we needed from him”
    
4. ●  “In all of the UX interviews I have sat through with Jeremy, he has always shown respect and patience with the couriers he interviews. He shows a lot empathy for them and advocates for their needs with his action points in his reports.”
    
5. ●  “Jeremy is always considering his colleagues and inviting them to share their POV. His participation is always well considered in all team meetings, where his colleagues value his good vibes and the way he makes them feel.”

Glownership

- ●  “on the initiatives we have worked on together (contact ways of working and OKRs, Jeremy has shown great ownership and at the same time team mindset as he always takes into account others vision.”
    
- ●  “Apart from the mentioned Best Practices in Maze, he has been always really aware of the resources when running projects. When needed some flexibility due to Local Teams priorities or amendments to be done in a prototype, he completely understood it and owned the project professionally.”
    
- ●  “He took ownership of presenting our work in progress in the Quaterly Review presentation, being effective and lean, and flexible and appreciative when he got feedback from us or Valentina”
    
- ●  “Jeremy is proactive and one of the keenest collaborators we have. He proposes new initiatives when opportunities are pointed out within our retros and involves everyone so as to improve and so that we all learn with each project he is involved in.”
    
- ●  “Jeremy is always open to challenge priorities when it comes to collaborating with the team goals, and he's always trying to do the best for the team even if it doesn't follow the original plan. Eg, in the Courier Earnings project he had planned to use a mixed-methods approach but when we noticed that we had already good insights to iterate the design and then test quickly a better experience, hi was really open to change the plan and go with the next steps that were more efficient for the team.”

High Bar

- ●  “I think Jeremy is a very high contributor and great professional, he always cares about delivering the best results possible maintaining a high performance standard, he is not afraid of "difficult" or "new" things and takes every challenge. If he could add to it to execute more quickly he would exceed every expectation”
    
- ●  “Really connected to the rest of values, he is conscious of what is needed to keep the High Bar, ready to have difficult conversation if something did not go as expected, so quickly adapting looking for the best solution, and managing feedback to get things done and execute quickly. With feedback requested, Miro boards prepared for new ideas on how to run projects, building instructions for respondents, etc.”
    
- ●  “Jeremy was an example for me regarding synthesis and analysis. I was impressed by how thorough and efficient he was in the process, by uncovering insights and asking relevant questions. He also exposed me to interesting ways of developing artefacts like user persona that contributed to have a high standard in the project.”
    
- ●  “Jeremy goes to every length to make his reports comprehensive and accurate. His report on the Courier Contact Tree was thorough and useful despite being a challenging first project for someone without a lot of business context and where the scope was somewhat vague and non-specific. He involved relevant stakeholders as much as possible and came out with excellent results.”
    
- ●  “Jéremy is constantly improving the way we work coming very well prepared to meetings with documents where he complied all points of view of stakeholders, he really cares about the quality of UXR and he is ultra-fast to deliver value on time”

HP

Although Jeremy has only been with the company for seven months, he has been well
integrated within the team and become a key member to lead and gather qualitative data to
provide data driving UX decision support. In a short time, Jeremy was able to successfully
lead and execute multiple research studies simultaneously, using a successful “team pairing”
approach to mitigate bias.
Jeremy is proactive and willing to help foster a growing culture of teamwork. Jeremy's
knowledge in the statistical field and his "intrepreneurial" mindset will be one of the keys to
taking the Customer Shopping Insights team to the next level.
Feedback from her colleagues has noted that, Jeremy consistently displays a collaborative
spirit by offering assistance and seeking clarification when necessary. Furthermore, his
presentations are remarkably clear and understandable.

Jeremy is an amazing UX Researcher. We’ve worked together on several projects and He is one of the most dedicated professionals I’ve worked with and is willing to go the extra mile. His expertise as Researcher is significant and it helped our team to come up with more efficient solutions, his recommendations added great value to our projects and helped us make better decisions. His collaboration with design was very smooth and his assistance definitely made a huge impact on our success. He was outstanding at conducting interviews and collecting then presenting his findings to the stakeholders. He is someone who welcomes feedback and believe in constant learning. He was a top performer and inspired us to give our best. I highly recommend Jeremy as an expert of his field and would love to work together again.

I’ve worked with Jeremy in a discovery project to create a vision for our product team. Jeremy has an outstanding work ethic and demonstrates a deep understanding of the appropriate research methods tailored to the questions the team has. He conducts user interviews with empathy and curiosity. He is able to gather, summarize and present more complex findings across multiple types of research, presenting fair conclusions to stakeholders backed by good qualitative data. When the team was stuck on something, he was quick to suggest how to adjust focus, reframe a problem or talk to someone new. Jeremy is a role model for what it means to perform while maintaining a positive attitude and being very humble, accepting feedback openly and being self-critical. He welcomes feedback from everyone no matter role or seniority and actively seeks ways to keep learning. His attitude is contagious and encourages an open collaboration. It’s been an absolute pleasure working with Jeremy, especially because of his passion and allyship with product design.

Comment un tuteur de stage novice peut-il devenir le mentor d’une stagiaire en seulement six mois ?  
Ma réponse ci-après :  
Durant mes six mois de stage de fin d’étude, j’ai pris plaisir à travailler avec mon tuteur Jérémy. Notez-ici que ce fut sa première expérience d’encadrement d’un stage.  
Jérémy a su m’accompagner dans l’accomplissement de ma mission. Il a su être rigoureux dans la planification de points d’avancement tout en m’offrant une liberté d’action essentielle à l’accomplissement de mes tâches.  
De plus, il n’a pas hésité à être bienveillant à mon égard en me communiquant des retours constructifs et encourageants tant d’un point de vue professionnel que personnel.  
Enfin, ce qui m’a le plus marquée fut la simplicité avec laquelle nous échangions nos compétences. En effet, Jérémy a montré une grande curiosité envers le Design, domaine qu’il souhaite mieux connaître, et a souhaité que je lui en apprenne plus.  
En définitive, je suis certaine que le prochain stage qu’encadrera Jérémy sera aussi une réussite.

I now have a clearer roadmap for my next steps and what I need to do to rework my portfolio.
* I am really impressed by his dedication and efforts he puts to solve a problem, and he understands and customizes the solution according to way my project is designed and my comfort level. I am looking forward to talk to him again and would recommend him to everyone.
