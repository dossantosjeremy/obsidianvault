# Million Dollar Weekend
* Track the trend (E.g. Google Trend)

* Look at costs of similar services
* Multiply the size of the market by the cost to deliver a service to reach the total addressable market

## Use a Marketing Plan
* Example from [Mint.com](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vRxXxGG0IPWx9k4ykOrlXIZRhEzDvjTDcEeSGcOGtKlts7dQA-zMBYRgq9OOeWy14qqwCMMGmT_Tu4E/pub)


# The personal MBA



> [!NOTE] What business is about
> Delivering value, that other people will want or need, at a price they are willing to pay, that satisfies their needs and expectations and which provides sufficient value. 


> [!NOTE] Economic Viability/Sustainability
> * When the economic model is sufficiently robust to not run out of cash. 
> * Revenue is adequate in relation to capital investment required and margins. 
> * Customer acquisition and retention costs and the time it will take to attract customers are viable. 
> * Contribution margins are adequate to cover the necessary fixed cost structure
> * Can our business develop and employ superior organisational processes, capabilities and resources that others would have difficulty in duplicating or imitating
> * In what ways do we offer the better, faster, cheaper than those of competitors
> * Where might we fall short
> * Is the economy sustainable
> 	* Will the revenue be adequate in relation to the capital investment you need and the margin you get?
> 	* How much does it cost to acquire and retain customers
> 	* How long does it take to attract customers
> 	* Will the contribution margin be adequate to cover the fixed cost structure
> 	* How much cash must be tied up in working capital, for how long
> 	* How quickly will customers pay
> 	* How slowly will suppliers and employees pay


> [!NOTE] Methods to price something
> Replacement cost: how much would it cost to replace. Add everything and add a margin for your time and effort. 
> Market comparison: how much for something similar in the market? 
> discounted cash flow: how much is it worth if it can bring value over time
> Works for things that are generating value over time
> Very common if businesses are sold or acquired to price them
> Value comparison: usually the most common way to price.
> The most effective: pricing depending on who you sell to.

## Finance Section
* Profit Margin: Revenue-Cost/Revenue
* Markup: Price-Cost/Price

* Cash flow: The amount of money that comes in and the amount that goes out. We see this in a balance sheet.
* Free cash flow: The money that comes in minus the money needed for operations. 
* Income statement: Cash flow alone is not enough. We need to relate the expenses, the money in with the operations and records. 
* Net profit: revenue - cost of good sold - expenses - taxes = net profit.

* Assets = liability + owner equity
* Net worth = assets - liability

is the average customer lifetime value substracted by the value streams cost, substract fixed costs. It's the same as multiplying the lifetime value by profit margins.
