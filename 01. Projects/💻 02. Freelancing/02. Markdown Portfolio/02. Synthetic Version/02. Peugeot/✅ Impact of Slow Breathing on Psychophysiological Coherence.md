## 📖 **0. Summary in One Sentence**

This study explored the effects of different slow breathing rates on psychophysiological coherence, finding that a rate of 5 breaths per minute optimizes heart rate variability and respiratory sinus arrhythmia, promoting emotional stability and mental clarity.

## 💬 **1. The Brief**

As a UX Researcher at Peugeot, I explored ways to help drivers achieve psychophysiological coherence because it facilitates emotional stability and mental clarity. However, the lack of knowledge about optimal breathing rates prevents them from maximizing these benefits.

---

## 📊 **2. The Results**

> [!info]  Low-frequency HRV power and RSA increased significantly at 5 breaths per minute.

> [!info] Participants reported stable relaxation levels across all breathing rates, suggesting consistency in perceived benefits.

> [!info]  Electrodermal activity did not significantly change, indicating no alteration in arousal through different breathing rates.

## 🛠️ **3. Our Solution**

### Research Questions

> [!question] What breathing rate maximizes HRV coherence markers and RSA?

> [!question] How does slow breathing affect electrodermal activity?

> [!question] What are the subjective feelings of relaxation across different breathing rates?

### Methodology

> [!example] Method
> **HRV Analysis:** Chosen to measure coherence markers; implemented through frequency domain analysis of HRV.
>   **Electrodermal Activity Measurement:** Chosen to assess physiological arousal; implemented by recording skin conductance levels.
>   **Subjective Self-Assessment Ratings:** Chosen to capture relaxation and emotional state; implemented using SAM scales post-exercise.

> [!example] Participants
Number: 37 participants
Key Characteristics: Ages 21-55, no recent mental or physical health conditions
Recruitment Criteria: No prior experience with controlled breathing, yoga, or meditation
