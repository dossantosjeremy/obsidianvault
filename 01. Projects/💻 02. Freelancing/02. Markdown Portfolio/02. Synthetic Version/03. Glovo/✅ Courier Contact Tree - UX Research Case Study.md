## 📖 **0. Summary in One Sentence**

The project aimed to understand couriers' preferences and expectations of the contact tree to create a more intuitive structure, thereby allowing couriers to resolve issues more efficiently without human assistance. By employing both qualitative and quantitative research methods, the team sought to align the contact tree's design with couriers' mental models.

## 💬 **1. The Brief**

Couriers need a way to efficiently navigate the contact tree to find support options because the current structure is not aligned with their mental models. However, the existing contact tree is too long and lacks usability, preventing couriers from quickly resolving issues.

## 💡 **2. The Insights**

### Discovery: Card Sorting Insights
> [!info] Couriers formed groups based on issue frequency, category, and severity.

> [!info] Couriers struggle with understanding wording out of context.

> [!success] The implementation of a redesigned Layer 1 information architecture resulted in couriers identifying content more quickly based on priority and frequency.

> [!check] Usability testing confirmed improved task success rates and reduced completion times for couriers using the new contact tree interface.

### Validation: Tree Test Insights
> [!success] The redesigned architecture offered couriers multiple ways to handle issues, increasing system flexibility.

> [!success] Couriers demonstrated a preference for either selecting tree options or direct contact, which reduced unnecessary contacts.

> [!quote] I would prefer if we had to click only on a few buttons and not to have to click 2 or 3 times.

> [!missing] Findability of certain options could still be improved as couriers expect to access their earnings from several locations

## 🛠️ **3. Our Solution**

### Research Questions


To address the misalignment between the contact tree structure and couriers' mental models, the team conducted card sorting and usability testing, leading to a redesigned contact tree that prioritizes grouping content by courier preferences and usage frequency. Additionally, wording throughout the tree was refined to ensure clarity and reduce cognitive load.

> [!question] How do couriers currently navigate the contact tree?

> [!question] What prevents couriers from efficiently finding support options?

> [!question] What specific aspects of the contact tree do we need to understand about couriers to improve usability and alignment with their mental models?

> [!example] Method
> - Card sorting was conducted via Miro Board to understand couriers' mental models and preferences, while usability testing was performed using prototypes to evaluate the interaction and navigation of the new contact tree redesign.
> - After a first iteration of the tree, tree testing was conducted as an unmoderated remote study to evaluate user navigation within the new information architecture and compare it against the current version, helping assess if users could effectively locate desired information.

> [!example] Participants
> - The moderated card sort participants included 10 French-speaking Moroccan couriers
> - The tree test study included 284 Glovo app couriers as participants, though specific recruitment criteria were not detailed in the research documentation.
