## 📖 **0. Summary **

This case study examines the development of a km earnings simulation tool to alleviate courier payment inconsistency complaints, revealing the critical need for improved communication and a simplified km review request process.

---
# 🔬1. Problem

Couriers need a way to understand and verify their km earnings due to perceived payment inconsistencies, which lead to dissatisfaction and increased contact rates. However, the current process is too complex and lacks transparency, preventing couriers from efficiently resolving discrepancies.

## 💬 **2. The Brief**

This project focused on addressing the dissatisfaction among couriers due to perceived inconsistencies in km earnings by creating a simulation tool that allows couriers to claim discrepancies easily and intuitively.

> [!example] Participants
> Participants included 5 new couriers (less than 50 orders) and 5 experienced ones, selected based on high contact ratios in Portugal and Spain.

The proposed solution involved a user-friendly prototype that simulates km earnings and simplifies the process of claiming discrepancies. By focusing on automation and intuitive interfaces, the design aimed to lower contact ratios and provide clearer, more actionable insights to couriers.
