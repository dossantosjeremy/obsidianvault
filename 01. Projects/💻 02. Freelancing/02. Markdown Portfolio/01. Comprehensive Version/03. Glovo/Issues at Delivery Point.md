## ðŸ“– **0. Project Story**

> [!INFO] Project Story  
> - **Problem Description:** Couriers experienced significant challenges due to customers omitting or inputting incorrect address information, notably affecting delivery point operations and increasing contact ratios.  
> - **Complexity:** The complexity emerged from integrating couriers' mental models and decision-making processes into a scalable solution that could minimize human intervention.  
> - **Stakeholders Affected:** Couriers and customer support teams were primarily impacted, leading to inefficiencies and increased operational costs.  
> - **Approach:** A blend of qualitative and quantitative research methods, including moderated user sessions and Maze tests, was used to explore the problem.  
> - **Obstacles:** Difficulty in extracting unbiased insights from emotionally invested couriers posed a challenge.  
> - **Solutions:** Implementation of a process to facilitate accurate address reporting and improved communication features was proposed.

## ðŸ’¬ **1. Executive Summary**

> [!INFO] **Background**  
> The project aimed to optimize the courier delivery experience by addressing issues at delivery points, such as incorrect addresses and customer absence, which inflated the agent contact ratio.

> [!WARNING] **Problem Statement**  
> Couriers need a method to accurately report delivery point issues as the existing process is ineffective and increases contact ratios.

> [!NOTE] **Solution**  
> Utilization of qualitative and quantitative research methods to identify couriers' needs, followed by app modifications to streamline the communication process.

> [!SUCCESS] **Impact**  
> The study sought to lower the agent contact ratio and the cancellation rates, thereby enhancing courier satisfaction and operational efficiency.
