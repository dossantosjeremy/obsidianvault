## ðŸ“– **0. Project Story**

> [!INFO] Project Story  
> - **Problem Description**: Couriers needed a more efficient way to find support information as the existing architecture was confusing and lacked usability.  
> - **Complexity**: Simplifying the contact tree while ensuring comprehensive coverage of support options was challenging.  
> - **Stakeholders Affected**: Couriers using Glovo; their efficiency and satisfaction were directly impacted.  
> - **Approach**: Implemented unmoderated remote tree testing to evaluate a new information architecture.  
> - **Obstacles**: Tight timeline for project rollout and complexity in simplifying options without losing essential functionalities.  
> - **Solutions**: Redesigned the contact tree, tested usability, and implemented changes based on feedback.

## ðŸ”¬ **7. Analysis**

> [!NOTE] Analysis Process  
> - **Data Processing**: Analyzed metrics such as success rate, directness, time, and path.  
> - **Frameworks**: Utilized metrics-driven analysis to validate design changes.  

---

## ðŸ’¡ **8. Insights**

> [!TIP] Insight 1: 
> The redesigned information architecture provides greater flexibility for issue resolution.

> [!TIP] Insight 2:
> Couriers efficiently handle navigation, suggesting reduced contact frequency.

> [!TIP] Insight 3: 
> There's room for improvement in locating specific information, aligning navigation with user expectations.

### âœ… 9. **Recommendations**

> [!SUCCESS] Recommendation 1: Direct Contact Options
> Propose direct contact alternatives when choosing a contact reason.  + Expected benefit: Streamlined issue resolution.
> **Severity**: High  

> [!SUCCESS] Recommendation 2: Critical Options Grouping
> Group less-frequently used options strategically.  + Expected benefit: Reduces user error and aids discoverability.
> **Severity**: High  

> [!SUCCESS] Recommendation 3: Usability Testing
> Conduct a moderated usability test on the finished UI.  + Expected benefit: Further design refinement and validation.
> **Severity**: Medium
