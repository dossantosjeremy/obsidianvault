![bg right:30%](https://via.placeholder.com/300)

- **Problem Description**: Investigate the effects of various slow breathing rates on psychophysiological coherence markers such as HRV, electrodermal activity, and self-reported relaxation.
- **Complexity**: Identify an optimal breathing rate to induce a state of coherence, marked by balanced parasympathetic and sympathetic activity, improving physiological and psychological well-being.
- **Stakeholders Affected**: Participants engaged in wellness, sports, and psychotherapy; researchers in psychophysiology and HRV coherence.
- **Approach**: A Latin square counterbalanced design with participants engaging in five different breathing rates while measuring HRV, skin conductance, and subjective relaxation.
- **Obstacles**: Participants with no prior experience with controlled breathing struggled to maintain rates, affecting data accuracy.
- **Solutions**: An optimized breathing rate of 5 breaths per minute was identified to increase coherence, demonstrated by increased low-frequency HRV power and RSA.
