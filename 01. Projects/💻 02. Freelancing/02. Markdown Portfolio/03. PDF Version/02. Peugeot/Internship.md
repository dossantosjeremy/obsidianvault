![bg right:30%](https://via.placeholder.com/300)

- **Problem Description**: The study aimed to evaluate Neural Up®, an auditory stimulus designed to regulate driver stress and affective state during vehicle pauses.  
- **Complexity**: It was challenging to measure both physiological and psychological impacts reliably, particularly with new auditory technologies.  
- **Stakeholders Affected**: Drivers and passengers needing stress management solutions during driving pauses were directly impacted.  
- **Approach**: A mixed-methods approach was employed using psychometric questionnaires and physiological measurements (skin conductance and heart rate).  
- **Obstacles**: Difficulty in calibrating auditory stimuli to avoid discomfort and managing data interpretation challenges.  
- **Solutions**: Robust testing in a driving simulator with clear participant communication and specialized analytical tools.
