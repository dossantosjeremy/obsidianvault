You fill up this form and you get a chance to book a meeting on a calendar. 
People answer the form, and then it sleeps for 4 minutes. 
It provides white glove service with the perception of high quality. 

Split the trigger and the list responses to be able to "debug"

Set multiple variables => Set formatted date time and it adds 3 minutes to the set date. 

Recreated a forwarded message so that it appears as if it was forwarded by the referral partner. 
It gives plausible deniability. Pass off the request and make it customized so that the partner has the support. 

It takes energy, it takes stufff... 

I pass this off, i do not have to be liable for any success or failures. It is pretty clean. 
We have a booked calendar meeting with the automation partner. 

This is a pre-packaged product you can sell to other people. 
It works for digital agency. 

# This Make.com Proposal System Generates $21K/Mo
[](https://www.youtube.com/@nicksaraev) 
* Very simple and streamlined make.com system that allows you to send a proposal before the end of the phone call with the lead. 
* When you sell high ticket stuff, you need to have nice proposals. 
* It will at least certainly help
* You do not want to get stuck in the proposal hell, spending majority of your time being stuck in a proposal , when you should spend majority of your time on the phone with the prospect to try to sell a service. 
* At the beginning we want to catch a discovery phone call entry. It will be responsible for catching the proposal. 
* Every time I have a call I will jump over to typeform (can help to bookmark it)
* I would login my discovery phone call. 
* First, I would put the client's information, which would take 10 seconds. 
* I would then define an outcome.
	* Sending a proposal, this meeting is not a fit, this meeting is a flake? 
* We can paste in a one-sentence description of their business. 
* We are using AI to generate a large portion of this proposal system, so we need to provide context for the system. 
* What is their problem? We write a problem statement. What are they suffering from. This is a way for us to press a bit on their pain points. Why is that a problem? Also what is the problem? If you could summarize it as quickly as possible, what would you say your problem is? 
* We can use artificial intelligence which allows you to take crappy notes, nothing fancy. 
* What is your proposed solution? 
	* Usually you can write it down in bullet points. 
	* Example: This is a 
* Then log: How long will the project take?
* How much do you want to charge them? 
* Any additional costs for platform? And then click on submit. 
* The end result is: If I click on a button, they are going to receive a very high quality and polished proposal
* The proposal looks this way: Everything in yellow is AI Generated. 
* The problem statement is generated based on the gibberish problem we wrote down earlier. 
* The specific proposal uses a diagram. 
* Show some social proof
* Show a timeline: Milestone and Projected Timeline
* Timelines are almost always bullshit anyways. 
* Pricing
* Implementation fee and platform or software fee. 
* It is then linked to a a pandadoc which allows to sign automatically. 
* The highest ROI possible is to talk to the customer. The lowest ROI possible is to try to polish the proposal. 
* Feed in a JSON. Train it with in-context learning 3-4 times 
* Parse the json. Turn it in a make.com module
* Do the same with milestones. 
* Select a proposal template generated in pandadoc and use it. 
* Send it in an email and send another email on top asking for
	* Hey Peter, thanks so much for the call. 
	* I just want to answer some questions ahead of time that I usually get. 
	* 
	* The moment you sign, I get paid immediatly. 
	* The second that you pay, I get a notification in 24 hours 
	* Use the pandadoc module proposal template. 
	* We are going to take a proposal and add a couple of 
	* Insert variables into PandaDoc. 
		* Now, here is what you are suffering from:
		* Introduce a variable. 
		* This is understandably affecting your bottom line. 
		* This is how we are going to remedy this. 
	* Delete bullshit pages. 
	* When the client or customer receives this after a phone call
		* Paraphrased on their own words
		* Shows we are listening
		* Shows we can solve their problem 
		* This enough might be enough to secure a sale. 
	* Payment: we need to assign the actual client as the payer. 
	* The payment can be pulled from the pricing table. 
	* You can customize the bill based on make.com 

How to build this out 
* What is the client information? 

![[Pasted image 20241214183221.png]]
* Use a black and white theme
* Use a problem statement - what is their problem?
* We need to catch the responses
	* We add a sleep
* Then we create a document using a templat, e.g. in pandadoc
* E.g. pandadoc proposal template id
* Using AI
	* Generate contacts surrounding the problem
	* The way it impacts the market and why it is a big deal
	* Potential systems of what you can do for them
	* Use the json module to parse that, using the parse json

Automations allows you to do something in seconds that would normally take you hours.
