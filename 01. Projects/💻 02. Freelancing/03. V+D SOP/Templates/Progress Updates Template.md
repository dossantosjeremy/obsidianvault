## Progress update templates

Below are templated progress update emails. If you’re sending these over a messaging platform (Slack, Teams) remove the signature portion—it’s cleaner.


Hi [Client]—progress update for you.

Here's where I’m at.

- I just wrapped up X.
    
- Next up is Y.
    
- Everything looks great so far! A little bit ahead of schedule, actually.
    

Looking forward to delivering this for you.

Thanks,

Hi [Client],

I know I said I’d deliver a progress update [date] but we just wrapped [portion] up a little early and I figured I’d collect my brownie points.

- Just finished X
    
- Y should be done on [date]
    
- If you have any questions just shout
    

Thank you!

PS you hear about [news] the other day? Saw it on my feed and thought about [company]. 

Thank you!

### Project delivery template

  

Hey [name], 

  

Had a blast working on this—just wrapped up your [XYZ project].

  

I always include documentation alongside every delivery, so you and your team know how things work. 

  

1. Here's a guide I recorded showing you how to use the scenario and how to get your leads [link]. 
    
2. If you'd prefer text, I also wrote an in-depth piece of documentation here [link].
    

  

Would you mind taking a look at this and letting me know your thoughts? Assuming everything is good to go, I'll send you over an invoice for the remaining balance and we can wrap things up.

  

PS I have a bunch of interesting ideas for you I’d like to share after we’re done. I think I could realistically double [company]’s current [bottleneck] with some tweaks. Let me know if you’d like to hear them.

  

Thanks,

[Your Name]
