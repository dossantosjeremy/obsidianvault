## Onboarding

1. Money change hands
2. Hosting a kickoff call [[KickOff Call SOP]]
	1. Discussing timelines
	2. Defining availability window
	3. Talk about expectations
3. Get clients to sign up to platforms live
4. Walk through any issues
5. Add everything to a Password Manager or a Password Manager System. 

## Delivery - Fulfillment 
1. Start working on the project
2. Copy blueprints, templates, to the client's workspace

• Copy three systems from me or another builder on YouTube. For instance, my proposal generator
system, my content repurposing system, and my ClickUp CRM. These are what you're going to sell.
• Create templates, blueprints, etc around these systems. Learn them inside and out. Become an expert
in these highly specific domains—it will only take you a few hours. Then, when you get an offer for a
related system, you'll know how to get 80% of the way there. You've just 5x'd your leverage.
• Don't rush to innovate. You know much more about this than most of the businesses you'll be selling
to and don't need to build an eighth Wonder of the World. Sell 1-7 first.

**Go above and beyond as often as possible.**
Cost: $0.
This is particularly important in your first few weeks. Why? Because it helps you get referrals, which are
substantially easier to both acquire and manage than cold leads.
• What most service providers think is that going above and beyond is silly, because it dilutes the ROl
on their contract. le if they spend a couple of extra hours to make the same amount of money, they
think they're "losing" that time.
• In reality, that time significantly improves the likelihood of a referral or repeat job. And the moment you
get one of these, you've just acquired a client for free, which is about the most valuable thing a
person can do in the agency space.
• What are some examples of going above and beyond? Deliver every project with a custom video; write
team documentation (for free). Add additional features you didn't talk about during the scope. Leave
positive reviews on your client's pages without them asking.



1. Customize the template to the client's request
2. Deliver progress updates
	1. Use templates [[Progress Updates Template]]
	2. Send weekly, biweekly, monthly, until completion
3. You complete the project
4. You test the flow E2E
5. Create a Google Doc to outline the SOP to use the new system
6. Record a video to deliver the project from End to End
7. Send a templated message with an upsell to the retainer, secondary product, etc.

## Scoping a Project
1. What is the deliverable visible to the client going to be?
2. Do a map and identify API steps as different shapes. 
3. For each API step, map the input to the output. 
4. Make sure the data you are looking for works and is present in the system. ![[Screenshot 2024-12-08 at 10.30.27.png]]

## Writing a detailed Proposal and Statement of Work (SOW)

## When the project is completed
* Project is completed? (1)
* Then we do an E2E test. (1)
* Then I copy all blueprints and templates.  (1)
* Everything is stored in Drive. (1)
* I record a Loom Standard Operating Procedure. (1)
* I take screenshots (1)
* I write a text Standard Operating Procedure with LLM and Screenshot. (1)
* I write a scope retainer proposal (1)
* I send a templated delivery email. (1)
* We make revisions (if needed) (1)
* The project is considered delivered. (1)![[Screenshot 2024-12-08 at 10.30.45.png]]



## Agency Lifecycle

1. Marketing: you spend money on advertising or outreach to book a sales meeting with your prospect.
2. Sales: you'll convince said prospect to want to work with you by sending over a proposal/contract.
3. Onboarding: after signing, you'll "kick the project off" by welcoming them, giving them peace of mind
& giving/taking everything both parties need for a great project.
4. Fulfillment: you'll provide regular updates to the client while completing their project.
5. Delivery: you deliver the project, oftentimes with room for revisions.
6. Retention: you'll routinely & regularly follow up with the client in an attempt to get more work.

• Logically, as a new agency, you have all the time and energy in the world for onboarding, fulfillment,
delivery, and retention... you just don't have any clients yet. That's the bottleneck.
• That means your constraint is almost always sales and marketing. Solve this first.
• From there, other steps eventually become constraints, but you cross that bridge when you get to it
(i.e you'll eventually have to optimize onboarding, fulfillment, delivery, retention, etc—just not yet).
## Bottleneck Thinking![[Screenshot 2024-12-08 at 10.57.09.png]]

![[Screenshot 2024-12-08 at 10.58.29.png]]

1. Sales
	1. Interested
	2. Proposal Sent
	3. Invoice Paid
2. Fulfillment pipeline
	1. Kickoff call
	2. Flow Mapping
	3. Development
	4. Testing
	5. Delivery

## Bottlenecks according to revenue (usually)


| Revenue           | Bottleneck                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <10k$/mo          | Lead Generation (here we should spend all available time improving lead gen)                                              |
| >10k$/mo <25k$/mo | Fulfillment (business is not scalable due to logistics)<br>You should spend all your time improving delivery              |
| Past 25k$/mo      | Hiring (business ready to scale but not possible because of people) - should spend all available time improving on hiring |
If something is working but not fast enough, just 10x it. 
* Send 100 emails/day => Send 1,000 instead
* 10x the ad budget
* Build automated systems that 10x the output
If something is not working: You need to spend time on research and development

Other ways
* Add more staff to bottleneck areas
* Invest in better technology and systems
* Redistribute workload across team members
* Document all processes, add SOPs, ensure SOPs are lean, have everyone use them
* Cross-train employees
* Outsource non-core activities
* Automate repetitive tasks
* Invest in a CRM, get organized
* Monitor KPIs with Dashboard
* Efficiency vs effectiveness - effectiveness is more important
* Beware of new bottlenecks created when solving others
* Don't neglect long-term strategy in pursuit of short-term gains but also do not lose the trees for the forest. 
* At the starting line? Get the first customer by whatever means.
