* Flexibility is an important skill to manage projects
* It is important to identify risks that could impact the projects
* Risk: Potential event that can occur and can impact the project. They are hypothetical. 
* issue: Known or real problem that can affect the ability to complete a task. 
* If the risk actually happens then the risk becomes an issue. 
* How we manage those risks is is risk management. It is the process of identifying and managing potential risks and issues that could impact a project. 
* it tells you what could go wrong with your project
* It also tells you who you will need to consult 
* It also tells you how this risk could be mitigated
* If you do not plan ahead: You are at risk of not meeting goals, timelines or success criterias. 
* By failing to plan for risk, you also fail to think through the different ways that the project could pivot and still meet its goals, even if an issue arises. 
* Risks can affect projects in a variety of ways that are difficult to foresee. 
* When issues arise: keep calm, figure out the root cause of the problem and come up with a solution.

* I have to get all the details right
* There are so many things that can change. 
* The client can come in and think they will want different requirements. 
* Changes happen, it is how you react and respond to these changes that is important. 
* You will not always have the right answer the very first time, things will change

## Test your knowledge: Risk Management
* A risk is an event that might occur and could impact a project in the future.
* An issue is a known problem; a risk is an event that might happen in the future
* Risk management: identifying and evaluating potential risks and issues that could impact a project
*   It helps determine how to mitigate potential risks.
* It helps identify who a project manager should consult about a potential risk.
* It reveals what could go wrong with a project.


## Phases of risk management
[[Phases of risk management  Coursera]]

Risk management involves the following steps
1. Identify the risk.
2. Analyze the risk: Define the likelihood of the risk happening. 
3. Evaluate the risk. Determine which risk to prioritise
4. Treat the risk. Make a plan regarding how you are going to treat this risk. 
5. Monitor and control the risk. Assign team members to monitors, track and mitigate the risks. 

## Uncover opportunities using risk management
[[Uncover opportunities using risk management  Coursera]]

* An opportunity is a potential positive outcome of a risk. 
* Examples of opportunities
	* Completing a milestone ahead of schedule
	* Discounted materials
	* Availability of resources (People, Investments, Equipment...)
* An opportunity is a potential positive outcome that may bring additional value to a project. 
* Make plans to seize opportunities. 
* Techniques
	* Brainstorming
	* Drawing on project history or prior experience

Review the following article for further information on using risk management strategies to identify and take advantage of opportunities that may occur during your projects:Â [The Risk Management Process in Project Management](https://www.projectmanager.com/blog/risk-management-process-steps)


## Tools to identify risks
https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/lecture/QBQ82/tools-to-help-identify-risks

* Brainstorming: Have a RACI chart to decide who to invite to this meeting. The best team is a diverse team, bringing diverse skill, diversities, backgrounds...
* A tool to use during brainstorming: A cause and effect diagram, or a fishbone diagram. ![[Screenshot 2025-01-22 at 08.20.44.png]]
* We have the risk on the right and the potential causes on the left. 
* We work backwards to idnetify causes for that risk
* Scope creep: Chanfges, growth and uncontrolled factors that impact a project scope after it begins
* We cannot account for all risks: we need to prioritise
* List the outcomes of a brainstorm in a register: A table or chart that contains a list of risks. 
![[Screenshot 2025-01-22 at 08.22.32.png]]

* Use the risk assessment technique: When qualities of a risk are estimated or measured. 
* We refer to how likely a risk is to occur and its impact. 
* Use a probability and impact matrix, to prioritise risks. 
* Impact: the damage a risk could cause if it occurs. It can be indicated on a scale of High, Medium and Low. 
* High: It will substantially alter the project. 
* Low: Slight impact, but will not rerail the project
* Probability: Likelihood the risk will occur. 
* These 2 scales come together to calculate the inherent risk rating. Inherent risk is determined by its probability and impact. Gives us a method to rate a risk. Also determined on a scale of high, medium and low. 
* Medium to high risks are the risks we should focus on and create detailed mitigation plans for. 
* Use color and shape to communicate distinct levels of risks. 
* Risk appetite: Willingness of an organization to accept the possible outcome of a risk. 
* You, team and stakeholders will have different appetite for risks.

Once the risk assessment is cimpleted, complete the risk register with high, medium and low ratings. 

## How to create a fishbone diagram

[[How to create a fishbone diagram  Coursera]]

* Fishbone diagrams = Ishikawa diagrams / cause and effect diagrams
* Helps teams to brainstorm potential causes of a problem or risk and sort them into categories
* Fishbone diagrams are also helpful in determining the root cause of a problem. 
* Root cause: Initial cause of a situation introducing a problem or risk. 

**Defining the problem**
Then adding the problem to the head of the fishbone diagram

**Defining the categories**
Categories can change depending on the type of problem or industry.  (e.g. people, technology, materials, transportation...)

**Brainstorming the causes**
Filling the list with some of the causes that could be related to each category.

**Analyze the cause**
Identify the root cause of an existing problem to figure out how to mitigate it for the current project
One cause is not necessarily the root cause

Fishbone diagrams are tools that are useful during any phase of the project. 
* Risk planning: Identify causes of a problem that may or may not occur
* Execution phase: Trying to find the root cause of an issue that has already occured.

**The steps to create a fishbone diagram are**
1. Define the problem
2. Identify the categories
3. Brainstorm the causes
4. Analyze the causes


## Types of risks
https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/lecture/3FysK/types-of-risk

### Time risks
* Possibility that project tasks will take longer than expected. 
* Poor time management may delay the project
* Time is money. 

### Budget risk
* Cost of a project will increase due to poor planning or expanding the project scope. 
* If overspending we might not be able to pay suppliers
* This might result in reputational damage for the company. 

### Scope risk
* Posisbility that a project won't produce the results outlined in the project goals
* Deliverabes of the project might not be acceptable to the stakeholders or customers. 
* This might defeat the purpose of the entire project. 

### External risks
* Factors outside of the company for which we have little or no control over
* E.g. environmental risk (major storm) or legal risk
* There will never be prescription to manage every possible risk. 

### Single point of failure
* Risk that has the potential to be catastrophic
* This means no one can make progress on a given task until an issue is resolved
* A single point of failure might be a power outtage. 

### Dependencies
* Relationship between 2 project tasks: Start or completion of one depends on the start or completion of another. 
* Dependencies must be addressed before a task can begin or another task can begin. 
* Dependencies are often a huge source of risk to a project. 
* If you do not plan for dependencies you may hit project schedule or outcome issues
* We can share the out of office plans at the start of a project - to make sure, for instance, of everyone schedules. Make sure there are backup plans to maintain the project's schedule. 

### Types of dependencies
* Dependencies that the team has control over: These are internal dependencies
* External dependencies: Dependencies you have no control over
* No project is risk-free. 
* No project is risk-free. But with careful planning we can acknowledge risks. 

## Managing single point of failure risks
[[Managing single point of failure risks  Coursera]]
* Single Point of failure: could cause a signifiant disruption to the project and even shut it down. 
* Having only one SME is an example if a single point of failure risk. 
* Mitigation strategies
	* Avoid the risk: using another product
	* Minimize the risk (e.g. workaround): Having multiple providers
	* Transfer the risk: e.g. using a company that is an intermediate and takes on the risk themselves
	* Accept the risk: Dedicate a portion of your budget to managing the risk


## Visualizing dependencies
* Dependency: Relationship between project tasks in which the completion of one task is reliant on the completion or initiation of another. 
* Finish to start: One task must finish before the next one should start. 
* Finish to Finish: Task A must finish so that task B can finish as well. 
* Start to start: Task B cannot start until task A has started as well
* Start to Finish: Task A must begin before Task B can be completed

**Dependency graphs
* As a project manager, we use dependency graphs to visually represent the flow of work during a project. 
* 
![Dependency chart showing activity, work and relationship for making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/QW7fRqMkRx-u30ajJOcf1w_e0e100d573db40a8b9507abc528652a2_C3M4L2R3_E.png?expiry=1737849600000&hmac=3NSnxwmTQ1HNwdwIvg-4y-eEJe_Odc3_-lU25-V3i18)

Dependency graph: Helps visualize different dependencies and the flow of the work that needs to be done on a project. 
Helps to identify risks associated to them. 


## Risks mitigation strategies
* Risk mitigation planning: Finding ways to eliminate or reduce the impact of potential risks to the project
	* Avoid: If you learn that a contractor has a poor reputation for meeting deadlines: hiring another contractor. 
	* Accept: If the probability and impact of this risk is low. 
	* Reduce / Control: Decision tree when building mitigation plans
		* Decision tree: Flowchart to visualize the wider impact of a decision on the project
		* Making a flowchart to visualize the risk and potential options to address it 
		* Have daily check-in meetings with the team to ensure they stay on top of their tasks
	* Transfer it: e.g. it is too risky to grow plants onsite at office greens due to bad weather, pest to impact the product... When transferring, you don't risk to lose time, resource or money. 

## Document the risk management decisions
* Risk management plan: Living document that contains information regarding high level risks and the mitigation plan for those risks
* Ensure the teammates and stakeholders have a clear understanding of potnetial problems and the plan to address them. 
* Risks management plan should be updated regularly to add newly identified risks, remove risks that are no longer relevant, and add changes in the mitigation plan. 


Risk management plan template
* Author
* Status of the document
* When was the document created and updated
* Document objective
* Executive summary of the project (brief introduction, outline of the potential risks for the project)
* Risk registar we had earlier: Table or chart of potential risks
* We give a risk rating: Inherent risk is a risk calculated by its probability and impact. 
* Mitigation plan
* Appendix: Probability and impact chart, probability and impact matrix
* Share with the team and stakeholders to get input and that they are aligned. 

## Communicating risks to stakeholders
* Communicating early and often to stakeholders the risks as it sets expectations. 
* It helps them prepare for if anything comes along 
* It sets expactations about what they can potentially expect. 
* It also helps to show what you had planned for those risks. 
* It also gives opportunities for them to suggest ways they can help you if an issue arises. 
* It depends on the severity of the risk. For low level risks, something as low as an email might suffice. 
* When sending weekly updates to stakeholders, mention the low level risks and mention how you address them as they arise. 
* For medium-level risks, have an email between you and your stakeholder. Share the specifics and your plan to mitigate it. Link to the project management plan. Write Urgent in the subject line, to stress the email's importance. 
* Serious nature of high level risk: Thorough level of communication. 
* Present in an agenda,with what the plan to mitigate it is. 
* Ask insights and feedback to stakeholders on how they plan on mitigating those risks. 
* Always a good idea to communicate the risks to the stakeholders. Adapt the communication style to the severity of the risk.

* Important to de-risk, look ahead, communicate risks to the appropriate stakeholders to make sure you deliver on your commitments. 
* Discuss with the right people. 
* It should be a collaborative thing. 
* What are the landmines, what can go wrong? 
* Problems that are really ambiguous and you have to come up with a solution to that problem
