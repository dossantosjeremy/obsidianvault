## Starting a communication plan
* It helps to manage all kinds of communication that happen throughout a project. 
* Communication plan: Organizes the process, types and expectations of communication for the project. 
* It is important to have a communication plan, especially for different stakeholders, phases or change management involved. 
* We need to address the following
	* What needs to be communicated
	* Who needs to communicate
	* When does it need to be communicated
	* Where is information stored
**Sample communication plan**
* Type of communication: status update, issues, feedback from users, daily check-in...
* Who do you communicate with: key stakeholders, core project team
* When to communicate: frequency + key dates (deadlines or major meetings)
* Key stakeholders will get the information less often (e.g. in a weekly summary email), but the core project team can receive more detailed info through daily email updates or virtual check-ins
* How to communicate: email, in person, formal presentation...
* Goal of the communication: This is the why (e.g. progress update, risks and address barriers, next steps, lessons learned...)
* Include the resource links - where is information located. Relevant information should be easily accessible. 
* It allows for continuity of project information - e.g. a new project manager should be able to access past information. 


## Developing a communication plan
* Who 
* What
* Why 
* When 
* How

Planning communication upfront increases effectiveness of the communication, gets stakeholders involved and everyone engaged. 

RACI charts and stakeholders map can help you identify what types of communication work best for each person or role. 

Example: if we have stakeholders that are busy executives, we can send a newsletter. The core team might benefit from a daily stand up. This is common in agile project management. 

Instead of a daily meeting, it can be communicated through a daily email, to report which are the action items that are being worked on through the day. We can also use a project tracker for tasks and milestones. 

Who needs to receive info? Recipients. Go back to RACI charts and stakeholder maps. Ask the following:
* Who needs to be informed of major milestones?
* Who needs to be heavily involved in the details?
* Who has high interest in the project?
The core team usually checks in every day
The other related teams can check in every week
List contact information and timezones in the communication plan

If struggling about which type of communication to use? 
Think about the frequency. 

If unsure, always ask core stakeholders. Which are methods of communication that works best for you? 
For the core team: Check-in regularly, how are people doing on tasks, do they need help with anything? 

**Key dates**
Listing key dates and times are important for coordination. 
Not everything needs to have the key dates. If something is weekly, indicate the day of the week it will happen. 

**Best way to communicate**
Deciding how to best communicate is a skill. 
If someone does not have a lot of time - you need to be concise and know exactly what you need from them. 

**Email**
Write too much to the email and you will be losing the audience. 
Write a summary at the top of the email, limited to 2-3 sentences, with the key points and action items. 
Include a longer section at the bottom for those who need additional details

The goal of communication is getting your point across effectively, so you need to think carefully about what you need to accomplish with each type of communication. 

Try to answer: **So what?** Why should people care about what I am sharing? 

**Sender / Owner**
* Define who should be responsible for each communication.
* Assign communication types to each person. 
* Always check-in with everyone to make sure the communication meets their needs
* Preferences
	* Some people are more visual
	* Some people prefer to listen to a presentation
	* Some people prefer to analyse the information on their own first. 
* If you share the information in only one way, you will lose people along the way. 
* A great way to optimise the communication style, is by sending a survey that asks 3 questions
	* What is working in how we communicating with you about the project
	* What is not working
	* Where can we improve the communication with you

**Communication plan**
* Who needs to be involved
* What needs to be communicated
* Why it needs to be communicated
* How often it needs to be communicated and how
## Best practices for building a communication plan
Identify the answers to the following questions
* Who are your stakeholders: Make a RACI Chart or a Stakeholders map.
* When and how often should you check in with the stakeholders? What methods of communication? How much in detail should it be? 
* Goals: What is the goal of the communication - do you need a response? 
* Barriers: Any time zone limitation? Language barriers? Do some stakeholders require time to reespond? Any privacy or internet access issues? 

**Document and develop**
* Create a central source of truth to document these answers
* Document all the communication needs and develop your plan
* Add a column for notes / relevant details that need to be tracked
* Use formatting to highlight key details in the plan
* Sharing the document with the team - also allows you to make sure you are not missing any crucial piece. 
* Test your plan - to make sure there is no technical problem
* Make sure your stakeholders have not changed over time
* Evaluate if you are over- or under- sharing information or missing stakeholders. Do this through
	* Anonymous survey forms
	* Polls or open feedback sessions
	* One on one conversations, check ins with key stakeholders

## The value of project documentation
- Having a central place where to store documentation is crucial. 
- It is important that information is organised and labelled correctly into folders. 
- Documenting and organising plan: visibility and accountability. 
- Having up-to-date plans: make sure there is no room for misinterpretation. 
- Summarize information for people who are not the main ones involved
- It is also important for project continuity
- Store everything in a centralised place. 
- It is part of responsibilities of a PM: Knowledge Management. Looking at why the decision was made this way by looking at old plans, moving on with more informed decisions. 
- Determine what kind of information to share with whom and when. 
- Focus on what kind of key information specific people need to know. 
- Protect sensitive information. 
- User test data is highly sensitive and should not be made available. 
- Only share information on a need to know basis. You need to share the information at the right time with the right people. 
- PII is anything that could be used to reveal someone's identity. 

# Organizing project information
* Have all the project resources in a way that you or anyone working on the project can access quickly. 
* A handy way is to use a shared drive and use one file that links all of the files and resources that the project uses. 
* Create a folder, label it with the name of the project. 
* Store all of the project files. 
* Create subfolders and store them in the main project folder. 
* Create a centralised planning document that links all related documents. 
* This acts as a centralised guide that links all required files from one access point. 
* Use sheet with tabs that contain the project information, each in a separate tab
* It is helpful to include an overview sheet that would link any non-spreadsheet files. 
* Also provide
	* Brief description of the project
	* Instructions for how to use the sheet
	* communication expectations 
	* The overview sheet is called the dashboard (which refers to that - you can decide how you want to label yours)

# Organising content for an interview
- Always think about packaging and telling a story behind the work you do
- An artifact is anything you put together that describes or showcases the work you are doing: That could be an executive brief, or something tactical as a role and responsibilities sheet. 
- It is important to keep it organised because it would be for anyone who needs to engage it with it. 
- It is also important to have them accessible to have a baseline of where you started and how far you've come. 
- It is important to mention how those artifacts allowed you to be successful. 
- it is important to show how far you have been to the project but also your abilities to conduct it from start to finish, and your contribution. 
- The quarterback also runs the playbook. 

## Documenting experience in a resume
* You need to break down your experience, but also your accomplishments and skills. 
* Also write a brief objective/profile summary - 1 to 3 sentences about you. 
* A profile is useful if you are looking to change careers and emphasize transferable skills to recruiters. 
* Central element: current and previous employers' experiences. 
* Include start and end date, and 2-3 bullet points including job responsibilities and accomplishments 
* Education: Online degrees, certificates and other accomplishments 
* Skills: Especially those relevant to the PM work
	* Enabling decision-making
	* Communicating
	* Flexibility
	* Strong organizational skills
	* Ability to manage tasks
	* Work well with others
	* Follow through on tasks
