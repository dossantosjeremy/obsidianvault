# The importance of budget setting
* Project budget: Estimated monetary resource needed to achieve project's goals and objectives. 
* Consider potential and projected costs
* Break the project down by milestones. 
* Milestones: Important point in the project schedule that indicates progress and signifies the progression of a deliverable. 
* There are costs associated to activities and tasks. You can calculate expenses for a particular period of time. 
* Forecast: cost estimate, projection over a period of time. 
* Costs:
	* Labour
	* Operating costs
	* Costs to obtain associated materials like hardware, software or equipment
* In project management, a budget is a deliverable, it is a success metric. 
* It is a tool to communicate what is needed and when it is needed with stakeholders
* It will have a direct impact on the company financial viability. It is an integral part of a project management. 
* It happens in the project initiation phase. 
* You may be tasked with obtaining approvals for spending. 
* The budgetting process happen on the conjunction with the scheduling process which is highly dependant on the cost
* A project sponsor will review and allocate estimation costs
* Most projects work on the following
	* Increase workforce productivity
	* Increase revenue
	* Attend to save costs. 
* Staying on budget: one of the trickiest tasks. 
* Important to not be under or over budget. 
* Public traded companies need to report on their finances . Going too far over budget will lead to adjustments in budgets the years after. 
* A proejct manager must show the requested amount of money was used in order to secure enough budget for future projects. 
* For smaller businesses, especially important to not spend too much . 

# Key components of a budget

When creating a budget, a project manager must account for
* Understanding stakeholder needs. Understanding what stakeholders expect. Project sponsor needs the project to come at a certain cost to make a profit. 
* Budgeting for surprise expenses.
* Maintaining adaptability
* Reviewing and reforecasting throughout the project: Create a separate revised project based on how the project is tracking. 
* You may need to shift costs and recalibrate within the project budget. You can reallocate dollars as necessary. 


Things to consider when planning a budget
* Resource cost rate: Cost of a resource. Labour, tools, equipment, material and software. How much will each of these resources cost the company. 
* Reserve analysis: account for buffer funds you may need. This is a method to check for remaining project resources. 
	* Review potential risks to the project and determine if you need to add buffer funds. 
	* New costs you did not foresee will arrive
* Contingency budget
	* Money included to cover potentially unforeseen events that are not accounted for in a cost estimate. 
* Cost of quality
	* all of the costs that are incurred to prevent issues with product, processes, or tasks
	* Prevention costs costs
	* Appraisal costs
	* Internal failure costs
	* External failure costs 

# Project Budgetting 101

* Budgets: Initiation and Planning Phase of a Project
* Helpful tool to communicate to stakeholders
* Can double as a tracker for the project's progress
* Help control the costs, act as a baseline

## Tips to create the budget
* Reference historical data: review how the project was handled, what went well, learn from previous mistakes
Utilize the team, mentors and managers to give additional sets of eyes on the documents
Time-phase the budget: Allocate costs for the project tasks over the timeline 
Helps to track and compare planned versus actual costs over time
Check: Make sure it is straightforward to understand and that all calculations are correct. 


## Categorize the cvosts
E.g. direct and indirect costs

### **Direct costs**

These are costs for items that are necessary in order to complete your project. These costs can include:

- Wages and salaries of employees and contractors
- Materials costs
- Equipment rental costs
- Software licenses
- Project-related travel and transportation costs
- Staff training

### **Indirect costs**

These are costs for items which do not directly lead to the completion of your project but are still essential for the project team to do their work. They are also referred to as **overhead costs**. These costs can include:

- Administrative costs
- Utilities
- Insurance
- General office equipment
- Security

## Baseline budget
* Estimate of project costs started at the beginning of a project.
* Once gotten approved, we must publish the baseline and compare it to performance progress. 
* Gives insight into how the project budget is doing and allow to make informed adjustments. 
* Monitor the project budget, make adjustments if necessary. 
* We should rebaseline if we make changes. 
* Re-baseline: update or modify a project's baseline as a result of the approved change to the schedule, cost or deliverable content. 

## Perform a reserve analysis
* Helps account for any buffer funds you may need. 
* Review potential risks to the project
* Determine if you need to add buffer funds (also referred to as contingency budget)
* Account for cost of quality in the overall budget: cost that is incurred to deliver a quality product or service, extending beyond material resources. 
* This includes: addressing issues with products, processes or tasks, along with internal or external failure costs. 
* E.g.: Redesign a product or service due to defects. 

## Key takeaways
* Remember to use historical data and to time-phase
* Reach out to the team for support
* Capture direct and indirect costs
* Baseline the budget


## Video: Create a project budget

* Various resources and tactics
	* Historical data: Review past projects, similar to mine
		* See what past project managers did right or wrong. 
	* Leveraging experts
		* Use it to its maximum advantage
		* Reach out to colleague working in similar projects in the past
	* Bottom-up approach
		* Thinking about all the parts of a project from beginning to end
		* Making a list of anything that comes with associated costs
		* Ask the vendor for quotes, get a rough estimate of the cost
	* Confirming accuracy
		* Double check to confirm accuracy
	* Setting up a baseline
		* Dollar amount used to measure against to find out if you are on track or not. 
		* Revisit that number and adjusted. 
		* Size of the project determines how often you examine and adjust the budget. 
* Bottom up approach:
	* We break the project into tasks
	* We estimate the cost of an item
	* We add those estimates together
	* We add contingency and tax
	* We seek approval from key stakeholders 
* Then we assign cost estimates to each task
* Account for material costs
* Costs for miscellaneous: Items that do not belong in any of the other areas. Usually there are one or several items. Be sure to add these to the expenses. 
* A few line items
	* Start with the fixed costs that won't change over the course of the project (=fixed one time costs)
	* Then we need a line for travel expenses
	* We want to account for buffers and reserves - we need to account for unexpected costs that might arise later on. 
	* E.g. 5% of the project budget as a buffer. 
	* The client needs to be aware of this buffer and eventually adjust the scope
	* We want to include a planned vs actual cost. 
	* Every project will have an estimated cost and a final cost. We can keep track of the cost every step of the way. 
	* The goal is to have an estimated cost as close as possible to the final cost. You may have to recalibrate estimation during the project. 
	* The final cost comes in if you were not exactly on target with your budget
	* Each time you are put on a new project it is still helpful to look back on previous projects and see how close you cane to your goal.

## How to maintain a budget
* Crucial to enforce accountability. 
* Milestone: Important point in the project schedule that signifies progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable. 
* Milestones: Metric to track progress in a project. 
* Opportunity to re-view the budget, to identify if anything needs to be reset or revisited throughout the project. 
* Milestones: Checkpoint for budget management and payment. 
* Fixed contracts: Usually paid when certain milestones are reached
* Time and material contracts: paid monthly based on the hours worked and other fees associated with the work, like travels and meals. 
* Cost control: Project manager identifies that impact the budget and creates effective actions to minimize variances. 
* It is better to be proactive with the budget than reactive. 
* Control costs: Establish a sign off plan and inform stakeholders of what might occur. 
* Invoices: You need to make sure every changes within the project are agreed upon. 
* Never approve a cost if it has not been approved by others. Never spend money on something if it has not been approved by the project sponsor. 
* Make sure there is good business case before bringing it to stakeholders. 
* Manage changes as they are made: Update forecasts and estimates. 
* Accept that budget misses will happen. It's your job to bring the cost overrun within the acceptable limits. 
* Before the project starts, agree with the project sponsor about the acceptable limits: Is it 1%? 10%?
* Going under budget means we have not done a good job at initially estimating. Going under budget also means you could have spent additional money on the budget, meaning you would have extraresources or output. It may mean the budget for future projects will be slashed. 
* Adequately account for, adapt and manage the budget with that risk in mind. 

## Overcoming Budget Challenges
[[Overcoming Budget Challenges Raw]]


* Challenge 1: Budget pre-allocation
	* Work with the customer to set expectations on scope and deliverables within the allocated budget. 
	* For that you need a detailed planning. 
	* Make sure the amounts that were budgetted actually meet the costs. 
	* Track expenses in the budget.
	* Match these expenses against pre-allocated budget
	* Ensure you have sufficient funds for the remainder of the project. 
	* Track fixed and time and material based experiences. 
	* Fixed contracts: paid when certain milestones are reached. 
	* Time and material contracts: Paid for momthly, based on the hours worked and fees associated such as travel and meal expenses. 
* Challenge 2: Inaccurately calculating TCO
	* Total costs of ownership refer to the costs associated to the lifetime project / product. 
* Challenge 3: Scope creep
	* Scope creep can happen when additional work that was not planned for is given. It impacts the budget. 
	* What can lead to scope creep:
		* A vague statement of work
		* Conversations and agreements about the project that were not officially documented. 
		* Unattainable timeframes and deadlines. 
		* Last-minute asks from priority stakeholders.

## Introduction to Budgeting Terms

[[Introduction to Budgeting Terms - Raw]]
* Cash flow: inflow and outflow of cash in the project. 
* You need funding (cash) to keep the project running. 
* In some projects, the cash will stay the same until the end. In this case, it is important to monitor the outflow to ensure we have enough funding to complete the project.
* Capital Expenses: long term, major expenses like buildings, equipment and vehicles. They are for assets that the company will own and keep
* Operating Expenses: Short-term expenses required for the day-to-day tasks involved in running the company, such as wages, rent, utilities
* Talk to the finance department to make the distinction between apex and copex.
* contingency reserves: funds added to an estimated project cost to cover risks. They are referred to as buffers. To determine that we need to go through the risk management process and identify the risks that are more likely to occur. 
* Contingency: also used when actual costs are higher than estimated costs. 
* Management reserve: used to cover the costs of unindentified risks. 
* Management reserves are generally a percentage of the total cost of the project. The estimate is typically between 5 and 10%. 


## Understanding procurement

* We can compare project management to start a new hobby. If you want to learn how to pain, you need to acquire material (procurement) (purchase)
* Procurement: Obtaining all the materials, services and supplies required to complete the project.
* Vendors: Individuals or businesses who provide essential goods and services. 
* Vendor management: activity required in researching and resourcing vendors (sourcing for a specific talent / service). Sourcing estimated costs from companies we will use in a project and comparing them. 
* Vendor management
	* Sourcing vendors
	* Getting quotes for vendor's work
	* Deciphering which vendors will fulfill your needs
	* Negotiating contracts
	* Setting deadlines for vendors
	* Evaluating performance
	* Ensuring vendors are paid
* Contract workers example
	* If your company does not have, for instance, a resource for copywriting, you need to use an external resource. 
	* This contractor or team of contractors will draft a copy for the website for a slated amount of time.

## The procurement process

5 steps that make the procurement process. 

* Initiating: Planning process to define what you nay need outside of your current resources
* Making a case to gain extra resources via the procurement process. 
* Selecting: Deciding what supplies you need and which vendor you need to go through 
* Contract writing: Where contracts are developed, reviewed and signed. 
* Control: Make payments, set up the logistics and requirements to maintain quality, and ensure the services agreement is being met. 
* Complete: Where you will measure the success of the procurement. 

Agile project management: Oftentimes more collaborative with both the project team and the end supplier. There is a heavy emphasis on the relationship between these parties. 
The whole project team plays a large role in identifying what needs to be procured.  

Agile procurement management has a living contract that is adapted based on the evaluation of the project. 

Team reviews the project and deliverables in a reoccurring process and addresses feedback. 

It is important to have a positive relationship with the contract supplier because the contract might be modified multiple times during the project. 

**Traditional procurement management**: 
* Focuses on clear terms and deliverables. 
* The project manager could be responsible for the end-to-end procurement instead of the entire team providing input. 
* Contracts will feature lengthy and extensive documentation that will include fixed requirements and comprehensive details of the deliverables. 
* While this may appear rigid, you will have outlined clearer workstreams and deadlines. 
* Much more protected for unforeseen circumstances and will be able to adapt for unpredictable changes. 
* You may not have the room to renegotiate contracts if something changes. You may have to start the whole process all over again. It is best to spend more time in the negotiation phase in the traditional project maangement approach. There are official documents to help you in the process. 

## Tips for the procurement process

[[Tips for the procurement process - Raw]]

* Procurement means obtaining all the materials, services and supplies required to complete a project.

1. **Initiating:** planning what you need to meet your project goals
2. **Selecting:** deciding which suppliers and vendors to use
3. **Contract writing:** developing, reviewing, and signing contracts
4. **Controlling:** making payments and maintaining and ensuring quality
5. **Completing:** measuring your success


![Graphic with the five stages listed: initiating, selecting, contract writing, controlling and completing](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/dT_wGmZITei_8BpmSK3oow_66beadf810ec4d8a90c9f8a5a6d13033_Screen-Shot-2021-01-05-at-6.49.22-PM.png?expiry=1737072000000&hmac=ZEUff2l5oPVhGUWdr-CQnibeLlkzDoScAzcH6dFLnOA)

**Tips for initiating**
* While planning the project
* Figure out the materials, resources and supplies you need to get the job done. 
* Decide during this step which items are internally procured and which items are outsourced.
* Compare items specifications, components, quality measurement, standards and characteristics with the project's requirements.
* Find features you do not need. 
* This way you will know exactly what you want and don't want in an item, reducing total cost.

**Tips for selecting
* Determine vendors to source the items
* Find preferred vendors and if they have a reputation for delivering quality work on time. 
* Interview them to learn more about their products and services. 
* Make site visits to see how each vendor runs their business. 

**Contract Writing
* Requires to pay attention to details. 
* Pay attention to inclusion and exclusion in the vendor's offer. 
* Some items in the vendor price could for instance be provided at low or no additional cost. 
* If the vendor writes the contract: check for accuracy and clarity to make sure what you are getting from the vendor. 
* Consult with a legal and compliance team to ensure that everything in the contract is ethical and legal. 

**Tips for controlling
* Ensure work is being done according to the terms of the contract. 
* Periodically review the performance and quality of each vendor. 
* Be professional but firm to ensure project requirements are fulfilled and that all major milestones are met on time and at cost. 
* Conduct regular check-ins to make sure the work is being completed according to the plan. 

**Tips for completing
* Were the materials created good quality?
* Were there any issues with labor contracts?
* How were the relationships with vendors?
* Document the lessons learned. 


## Common procurement documentation
* A few documents that help the project manager go through different stages of procurement.
* For instance: NDA in the initiating phase. 
	* Standard in a lot of companies. 
	* Best practice to ask external contract workers to sign it
	* To keep information confidential
* Selecting phase: Request for proposal or RFP
	* Document that outlines the details and requirements of a project to be passed on to vendors
	* Used to solicit bids for vendors to then be able to select which vendor is best for your project. 
	* RFP is widely used in different departments in a company. 
	* It typically includes:
		* Overview of the project
		* Desired outcomes and goals 
		* Budget
		* Deadlines
		* Milestones 
		* Contact information
	* When making an RFP, make sure to add the following section to the document. 
		* The overview: general summary. What is the purpose of this project, what problem would it solve and what new doors will it open for the company. 
		* Goals: Measurable results you can aim to achieve throughout the process. 
		* Scope of work: Specifics of the project. How are you going to make sure you achieve those goals and if you will launch successfully. 
		* Milestones: Include the key milestones your project will include.
		* Include submission requirements - e.g. submit your RFP (proposal) alongside 3 prototypes. As well as a question that you would like the vendor to answer as part of the process. This helps to assess potential vendors. 
		* E.g. what issues do the contractors see upfront or how would be the cost breakdown

![[Pasted image 20250116093307.png]]
* Contracting phase: Statement of Work or SOW is created. 
* After the RFP is sent out, various vendors will review it and if they think they can fit the requirements of the proposal they will provide a proposal. 
* You should send the proposal to all possible vendors to make sure you get the best price, quality and value. 
* RFP may be used as a verb. 
* Both the NDA and RFP are fixed and should remain throughout the whole process. Changes might not be made. 
* Last document is the statement of work or SoW. An SoW: sent after the vendor is selected and evolves as the project goes on. 


## Creating a statement of work
https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/lecture/FaTRp/creating-a-statement-of-work


* A document that clearly lays out the product and services will provide to the rest of the organization. 
* SoW also provides a description of the contractor's needs and requirements to properly perform the services.
* It is important to include both the organization's needs and the vendors' needs. 
* All parties involved should mention what is expected of them to deliver the best products and services. 
* Sometimes the project manager can ask Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for their input. Legal advisors review document with me. 
* SoW: The products and services a vendor or contractor will provide for the organization
* How to create a SoW:
	* Include Page headers
	* Project, creation date. 
	* Include important stakeholders
	* Include the name of sponsor
	* Construct a table for revision. 
	* Create a purpose section: go into details about what exactly the outputs are. Include the target audience. 
	* Scope section: Detail what the service entails. Mention here that the service might entail
	* Mention what is not in scope or what does the project not include. It helps to draw clear lines and draw the right expectations. 
	* Mention the deliverables. Guides on how to take care of the plants, for instance. 
	* Mention what is out of scope or what does the project not include. This will eliminate any potential confusion and help set expectations for the vendor. 
	* Drawing clear lines and setting right expectations. 
	* Deliverables
		* Clear mention of what the deliverables will be
		* Milestones are an integral part of tracking progress and goals, they will need to be tracked here too. 
		* You want to make it clear what is the time you will take for projects. 
		* Add terms and conditions and any other disclaimer. 
		* For instance a disclaimer mentioning the revisions that might take place as the project goes on. 
		* e.g. just in case the scope changes because of unforeseen issues. 
		* Add revisions into the disclaimer. As a project manager, best not to overpromise and underdeliver. Always make it clear that you will try to stick to the schedule unless things outside of your control intervene. 
	* Add payment terms: Outline when the supplies need to be paid. 
		* Ensuring siupplies are paid on time will promote strong relationships
		* Good procurement practice will be to pay constractors upon delivery of good services, not before. 
	* Partnering with a legal team during the procurement process

## Obtaining procurement support

https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/lecture/nfeMa/obtaining-procurement-support

* Enlist the help of a legal team
* Depending on the company size, you may have a legal team, outsource a legal team, or reach out to legal advisors
* Laws will vary from country to country
* There are always laws in place
* Usually companies have a value and a mission statement. 
* Companies have a ethics and compliance department to help ensure that anything the company is doing is adhering to their values, mission and governmental policy
* As a project manager you also need to make sure that the various stakeholders represneitng the business are adhering to policies and processes. 
* Having contracts reviewed makes good business sense. 


# Importance of ethics when dealing with vendors

https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/lecture/WXIbi/ethics-in-the-procurement-process

Steps to safeguard ethical procurement:
* Knowing the business legal requirements to have a deep understanding of what is required. 
* Seek out the code of ethics for your profession. 
* The project management institute or PMI has a code of ethics you can access as a member or credential holder. 
* This helps assess ethical vs unethical procurement
* Honesty, responsibility, respect and fairness are the values that drive ethical conduct for the project management profession. 
* Use the best judgement based on what you think it means. 
* If unsure, ask a subject matter expert
* What you may face
	* Bribery 
* Consult legal team to make sure you do not run into these situations and that you are aware of those
* Be aware of potential issues with sole-supplier sourcing
* You need to perform non-competitive procurement, which happens when a company restricts the bidding to only one supplier. It may be common for companies that are more cautious about exposing trade secrets. 
* You need to justify why you are restricting bidding to one supplier only. 
* You need to be diligent when dealing with government agencies and officials. 
* Government agencies may have tighter regulations. 
* In the initiating phase, you need to define if a project is ethical. 
* Review piotential risks and put together an diverse team that you think is ethical. 
* You want to make sure the suppliers you are hiring are ethical. You want to make sure you ar ehiring them in an ethical way. You need to pay them a fair rate. 
* You need to understand the supply chain if there is one. 
* You need to carry out your duties: auditing each task and cost. Executing on quality control, or approving invoices. Focus on the day-to-day relationships with the vendors. 
* Remember to trust yourself. 

## Avoiding Ethical Traps in Procurement

[[Avoiding ethical traps in procurement  Coursera]]

* Ethical trap: Ethical Dilemma causing us to make a decision without regard for our ethical principles. 
* Few of the ethical traps
	* Corruption and bribery: Bribes, or percentage of the awarded contracts (also known as a kickback)
	* Sole-supplier sourcing: When other suppliers are not allowed to bid for contracts in which they would also be qualified. 
	* Interactions with state-owned agencies
* Understand the legal requirements for your procurements
* Stick to your ethical codes: Honesty, Responsibility, Respect and Fairness :  [**code of ethics**<svg aria-labelledby="cds-react-aria-210-title" fill="none" focusable="false" height="16" role="img" viewBox="0 0 20 20" width="16" class="css-8blerm" id="cds-react-aria-210"><title id="cds-react-aria-210-title">Opens in a new tab</title><path d="M4.5 17c-.412 0-.766-.147-1.06-.44A1.445 1.445 0 013 15.5v-11c0-.412.147-.766.44-1.06.294-.293.648-.44 1.06-.44h4.75c.213 0 .39.071.534.214a.72.72 0 01.216.532c0 .21-.072.39-.216.535a.72.72 0 01-.534.219H4.5v11h11v-4.75c0-.213.072-.39.214-.534a.72.72 0 01.532-.216c.21 0 .39.072.535.216a.72.72 0 01.219.534v4.75c0 .412-.147.766-.44 1.06-.294.293-.647.44-1.06.44h-11zm11-11.438L8.583 12.48a.681.681 0 01-.52.219.758.758 0 01-.521-.24.729.729 0 010-1.062L14.438 4.5H12.75a.728.728 0 01-.534-.214.72.72 0 01-.216-.532c0-.21.072-.39.216-.535A.72.72 0 0112.75 3h3.5c.212 0 .39.072.534.216A.726.726 0 0117 3.75v3.5c0 .213-.072.39-.214.534a.72.72 0 01-.532.216.734.734 0 01-.535-.216.72.72 0 01-.219-.534V5.562z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>](https://www.pmi.org/about/ethics/code) 
* Test the ethics. Ask yourself questions in each of the following categories
	* Shame: Would you be ashamed if someone knew what you did
	* Community: Would you want your friends to know the decision you made
	* Legal: Would you face legal action if you took this action
	* Situation: Would your actions be justified in this situation?
	* Consequence: Would a negative outcome be worth your actions?
