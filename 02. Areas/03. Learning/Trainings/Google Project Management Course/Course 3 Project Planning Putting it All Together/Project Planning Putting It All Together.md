# Module 2

[[Case study Run fast, pay later - Raw]] 

# Case study: Run fast, pay later
* When in doubt, escalate concerns.
* Work with the input of others.
* Work carefully through the project plan and don't omit important steps such as 
	* Elimination of tasks
	* Increase the team size if necessary - request more resources early on - do not try to execute without the necessary resources
	* Streamline activities - some tasks may be possible to do in parallel
* Take input from coworkers
* Be realistic when estimating time and effort for a project
* Take the time to evaluate risks and impact on the work
* Talk to team members about challenges

Reflection: Time Estimation

- Review your response to check if you considered these steps to improve the outcome of the situation: Before the project launch, the project manager should speak to the writers to more accurately determine how long it takes to do their tasks. 
- The project manager might identify the printer technology as a task that is out of the team’s control and add a task buffer. Additionally, when the project manager first learns about the printer issue, they should immediately update the time estimation and inform stakeholders.
- The project manager can also look towards potential time saving activities, including: eliminate tasks, increase the team size to get more work done and meet the deadline, and streamline any of the activities in order to complete them in parallel with other tasks.
- All-in-all, it’s important to perform time estimation, effort estimation, and add buffers to build realistic plans for reaching the project goal and ultimately, success!

  

**Overcoming Planning Fallacy**

- Be an optimistic realistic: Push for the best outcomes while planning for any contingency
- We should balance being optimistic and being careful about the time it could take to perform something.

  

**Do a work breakdown structure:**

  

  

Then for a given work, have a table with the estimates of time. 

  

  

- Plan for the what ifs. 
- Add some tasks buffers. 

  

  

**Capacity planning and critical time**

  

- Time estimation: Estimation of the time that will be required to complete a task. 
- Effort estimation: Estimation of the amount of work and difficulty required to complete the task

Helps estimat ehte length of time to complete the task. 

With this information, it helps to determine if we have the right amountof people to complete the work done. 

  

**We can use a technique called capacity planning**

Capacity: Amount of work that people or resources assigned to a project can complete in a set period of time. 

  

Capacity planning: Allocating people and resources to project tasks, determining whether or not you have necessary resources required to complete the work on time. 

We might realize we need more resources to complete the work on time. 

Even if someone spends 100% of time on a project, they will have limited capacity of the amount of work they can complete each day. 

Meetings, unexpected tasks… there is only so much that can be completed. 

  

How to prioritise?

- Plot the critical path of the project timeline
- List of project milestones that need to be reached in order to meet the project goal on schedule
- Mandatory tasks that contribute to the completion of each milestone. 
- Anything else is considered off the critical path
- Critical path: Bare minimum number of tasks and milestones necessary to reach a goal
- If we do not meet those tasks on time, that might lead to a project delay. 
- To identify the critical path: List all the taks and milestones for the project and the milestones they feed into. 
- This is a good moment to think about the work breakdown structure: Chart with all the milestones and tasks of a project into a hierarchy with order in which they need to be completed. 

- This includes a detailed overview of every project task. 
- Then, determine a task in the list which cannot begin until another task is complete.

- This will be a dependency
- Next work with the team to identify tasks and map each task from start to finish. 
- The longest path is the critical path

- Some factors that can impact capacity planning

- Identify which task can happen in parallel, meaning they can happen at the same time as other tasks - helps create efficiency in the schedule - identify ways to complete multiple tasks at the same time. 
- Also identify which task can happen sequentially: Tasks that need to be completed early on in the project. 
- Tasks that can be done at different portions of the project and different members of a team => In parallel
- Also determine which project task has a fixed start date. A fixed start date: Date at which you must start work on the task to achieve the goal.
- Example we need to deliver 100 plants by X day. The task of picking up those plants to deliver them then has to happen at a fixed time, one day before. 
- Earliest start date: Earliest date at which you can begin to work on a task. Set expectations to start working on a project. Example we know that to work with a client we need to sign contracts, having kickoff meetings… So the earliest start date would be 3 weeks after having started the first meetings

- Identify if a task has float or slack: amount of time you can wait to begin a task before it impact the project schedule and threatens the project outcome - These are high priority tasks with no wiggle room. It will inform what is and is not on the critical path. 
- Tasks on the critical path: zero float. There is no room for delays. Tasks which have float are not a part of the critical path. 

  

**Creating a critical path**

- List of project milestones needed to reach the project within schedule.
- List of tasks that are part of these milestones.
- Path that tells us where we are, where we are headed and when we will get there. 
- Essential tasks that need to be completed within the project to meet the end goal and how long will each task take
- Which task will impact the project schedule if scheduled finish dates are missed. 
- Capture all tasks (e.g. work breakdown structure). Focus on the essential tasks (e.g. need to do) and not nice to haves
- 2. Arrange them into dependencies. To identify dependencies, identify which tasks need to be completed before another one can begin. 

- Which task needs to take place before this task?
- Which task can be finished at the same time as this task?
- Which task needs to happen right after this task?

- Create a network diagram

- Diagram that will help visualise

- What tasks are dependent
- What tasks can be done in parallel
- Which tasks are not on the critical path

- Make time estimates with stakeholders

  

- Add up all the durations for the longest path. 
- Only include tasks that even if they go unfinished will impact the project finish date
- Also possible to compute using the forward and backward pass and the slack time

- The **forward pass** refers to when you start at the beginning of your project task list and add up the duration of the tasks on the critical path to the end of your project. When using this approach, start with the first task you have identified that needs to be completed before anything else can start. 
- The **backward pass** is the opposite—start with the final task or milestone and move backwards through your schedule to determine the shortest path to completion. When there is a hard deadline, working backwards can help you determine which tasks are actually critical. You may be able to cut some tasks—or complete them later—in order to meet your deadline.


## Identify: Time estimation methods - Ungraded Plugin

* **Effort estimation** predicts the amount and difficulty of active work you need to complete a task.
* **Capacity planning** allocates people and resources to project tasks and determines whether you have the resources to complete the work on time.


## [Getting accurate time estimates from your team](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-planning-google/lecture/W8iD4/getting-accurate-time-estimates-from-your-team#)

* Time estimation, effort estimation and capacity planning are all helpful techniques to create your schedule. 
* At the center of all this planning is the team. 
* We work with the team to build estimates and taking into account each person's capacity when building the schedule.
* You need to tap into the soft skills to get an accurate estimate from the team. 
* Soft skillsa re personal characteristics that help people work effectively with others. 
* These include crucial communication and interpersonal skills discussed over the course of the program. 
* 3 ways to use soft skills to gather estimates from the team
	* Asking the right questions: Think of it as a kind of interview. Think of teammates / the conversation as how do they work on given tasks. Then you use this information to build your schedule. Making sure you are asking effective open-ended questions that lead to the answers you are seeking. 
		* How long does it typically take you to mock up a website like this one? 
		* Then ask follow-up questions: How complex is this task? What are the risks associated with this task? When do you think you could have this ready?
		  
		  Step by step you will develop a better sense of your teammates' roles and their task. You will also be able to rely less on them for building time estimates. 
		  
	* Negotiating effectively
		* Bridge the gap between high-level goals of the project and day-to-day perspective of the team. 
		* Negotiating effectively can help to influence a team member to make your project their priority. 
		* Collaborate to find an outcome that works for everyone. 
		* E.g. if an estimate takes more time than what you thought, you can challenge this estimate by asking a follow-up question. 
			* E.g. Does the mockup include one or multiple pages
			* E.g. are you able to provide a mockup of one page only sooner than the proposed deadline? 
			* By asking questions, it helps to determine if the estimate is flexible or if you need to bring an additional designer. 
			* You can create a sense of shared ownership of the project. 
	* Practicing empathy
		* A person's ability to relate to thoughts and feelings of others.
		* Ask each person their workload. 
		* Ask about work load outside of their project. 
		* Ask about their overall work-life balance. 
		* Ask if they schedule vacation or leave during this period, if there are holidays during this period. 
		* Imagine if a designer is working with other project managers. You can work with other project managers to balance the workload 
		* People like to feel the work is valued. 
		* Part of empathy is getting appreciating from the work and collaboration you are getting from the team. 

## RESUME: Angel: The value of interpersonal skills in time estimation

* Soft skills: Emotional Intelligence - Be able to read other people and reading yourself. 
* Influencing the team in a good way 
* Asking the team to raise their input
* Understand the emotional need of the team: estimation, cost, labour...
* For task estimation and time estimation, the thing is just about asking good questions. 
* What is stopping you from going faster. How much faster could you go if I gave you this?
* What team would you need to get involved?
* The role is to see patterns in a project and having soft skills to bring the team together to solve that problem.
* Instead of blaming
* Having people walk through the estimate out loud: Can help with the realization of where we can optimize. 


# Developing a project schedule

- How to put all the information in a project plan
- An anchor of a good project plan: Clear schedule, containing all tasks of a project, their owners, an when they need to be completed.
- When we have a clear schedule, we can build a plan around that schedule with spreadsheets and Asana. 
- Gantt chart: Horizontal bar chart that maps out the project schedule. It is a highly visual representation of a project's tasks, with clear breakdown of who's responsible for the work and when those tasks are due. 
- Gantt chart is almost like a calender: features the start and end date of each task and the bars for these periods are aligned with the name of the task. 
- Bars cascade down the chart to illustrate the passage of time. 
- We also indicate when it will be completed. 
- Helpful tool to track schedules. 
- What tools to use to creeate Gantt chart?
	- Spreadsheets. 
	- Organize columns
	- The left part: will go things that were previously identified in a work breakdown structure. 
	- Include relevant information in rows organised by start date
- Right side: Organise according to the week estimate of completion
- We can use other tabs in the spreadsheet to link to other documents (RACI, project charter. Also include a risk management and communication). 
- Keeping all documents in one spreadsheet saves time and avoids everyone the burden to look for them in sepaeate emails. 
- Some teams will work better with tables with a list of tables or tasks, their owners and due dates and links with other relevant planning documents. 
- Perhaps the team works best with Kanban board 
- Regardless of the tools - if the project plan includes tasks, owners, start and end date and relevant planning documentation

# Project Plan Best Practices

* Careful review of deliverables, milestones and tasks
	* When entering the planning phase, a project can become more granular. 
	* You need to break the information further: milestones, and tasks
	* Each of the tasks will be assigned to teammates with a start and end date
	* You need to break down every deliverable into milestones and tasks
* Give yourself time to plan
	* There is a reason that planning has its own phase in a project
	* It is time intensive. 
	* Planning gives the time to you and the team to think realistically what you can accomplish.
	* Use techniques like effort estimation and capacity planning to get a realistic sense of how long the project will take
	* Use buffer time because rarely a project will go as planned. 
* Recognize and plan for the inevitable: Things will go wrong.
	* Even with thorough planning - unexpected setbacks and bumps in the road
	* We can identify risks that will most likely occur and prevent or mitigate those risks 
	* Buffers are a helpful tool to mitigate issues -> Create a risk management plan
* Stay curious
	* Ask lots and lots of questions. 
	* Input will help to build a stronger plan
	* Understand expectations, priorities, risk assessments, and communication styles
* Champion your plan
	* Can your teammates use the tools you use to build the plan
	* Is the information clear for stakeholders 
	* Will using this plan as a single source of truth help you and the team save time and energy?
	* By championning the plan, you influence your team to stay on top of the plan, to stay on track and update it regularly
