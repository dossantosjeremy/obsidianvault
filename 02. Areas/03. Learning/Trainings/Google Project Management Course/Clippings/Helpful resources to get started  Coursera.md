The Google Project Management Certificate will provide you with new lessons in each module. As you’ve learned, each lesson includes a series of videos, readings, activities, in-video questions, practice quizzes, and graded quizzes. In this reading, you’ll learn about providing feedback on course content, obtaining the Google Project Management Certificate, and acquiring helpful habits for successfully completing this certificate program. 

## **Providing feedback on course content**

Please remember to give feedback on videos, readings, and materials. Just open the resource and look for the thumbs-up and thumbs-down symbols. 

- Click thumbs-up for materials that are helpful.
- Click thumbs-down for materials that are not helpful.

If you want to flag a specific issue with the item, click the flag icon, select a category, and then optionally type an explanation in the text box.

This feedback goes to the course developers, not other learners, and helps create even better programs in the future.

## **Helpful habits to successfully complete the certificate**

As a learner, you’re bringing all of your past experiences and best learning practices to this program. The designers of this course have also put together a list of helpful habits that they believe will help you to be successful: 

1. **Plan your time:** Setting regular study times and sticking with them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or timetable to create a schedule, and list what you plan to do each day in order to break your work down into achievable goals. Create a quiet place to watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities so you can really focus on the material.
2. **Be curious:** If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Ask questions, search for more details online, check out the links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The little things you do to support your learning along the way will take your knowledge even further, open more doors in this high-growth field, and help you qualify for jobs.
3. **Take notes:** Notes are useful-to-remember information that you think might be important in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics.
4. **Build your career identity:** Your career identity is the unique value you bring to the workforce. [Watch this video<svg aria-labelledby="cds-react-aria-225-title" fill="none" focusable="false" height="16" role="img" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" class="css-8blerm" id="cds-react-aria-225"><title id="cds-react-aria-225-title">Opens in a new tab</title><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M1.5 3.5H6v1H2.5v9h9V10h1v4.5h-11v-11zM13.5 2.5H10v-1h4.5V6h-1V2.5z" fill="currentColor"></path><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M6.646 8.646l7-7 .708.708-7 7-.708-.708z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xbT4qMrot4) to learn about the key components of career identity and write your own career identity statement. Discovering and defining your own career identity makes you better equipped to choose a career path that aligns with your strengths, values, and goals and is more effective in your chosen profession.
5. **Study together:** It can be hard to find the time to progress through a Google Career Certificate with all life’s distractions.

## **Finding more information**

Throughout this course, you will learn the basics of project management. We will provide a lot of information through videos and readings. But sometimes, you may need to look things up on your own for additional learning. Things change fast in this growing field, so it is critical to do your own research so you can stay up-to-date on what is new. 

Here are some helpful project management resources available online:

- The [Project Management Institute<svg aria-labelledby="cds-react-aria-230-title" fill="none" focusable="false" height="16" role="img" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" class="css-8blerm" id="cds-react-aria-230"><title id="cds-react-aria-230-title">Opens in a new tab</title><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M1.5 3.5H6v1H2.5v9h9V10h1v4.5h-11v-11zM13.5 2.5H10v-1h4.5V6h-1V2.5z" fill="currentColor"></path><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M6.646 8.646l7-7 .708.708-7 7-.708-.708z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>](https://www.pmi.org/) is the leading association for those in project, program, or portfolio management professions. Their website provides guides, industry standards, articles, templates, job boards, certifications, and more to help support professionals in these careers.
- The [Scrum Guide<svg aria-labelledby="cds-react-aria-231-title" fill="none" focusable="false" height="16" role="img" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" class="css-8blerm" id="cds-react-aria-231"><title id="cds-react-aria-231-title">Opens in a new tab</title><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M1.5 3.5H6v1H2.5v9h9V10h1v4.5h-11v-11zM13.5 2.5H10v-1h4.5V6h-1V2.5z" fill="currentColor"></path><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M6.646 8.646l7-7 .708.708-7 7-.708-.708z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>](https://www.scrumguides.org/index.html) defines Scrum, a technique used in Agile project management. You’ll learn about the framework later in this program. This guide describes Scrum’s roles, events, artifacts, and the rules that bind them together. You can also find hundreds of free resources to learn more about Scrum at [Scrum.org Resources<svg aria-labelledby="cds-react-aria-232-title" fill="none" focusable="false" height="16" role="img" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16" class="css-8blerm" id="cds-react-aria-232"><title id="cds-react-aria-232-title">Opens in a new tab</title><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M1.5 3.5H6v1H2.5v9h9V10h1v4.5h-11v-11zM13.5 2.5H10v-1h4.5V6h-1V2.5z" fill="currentColor"></path><path fill-rule="evenodd" clip-rule="evenodd" d="M6.646 8.646l7-7 .708.708-7 7-.708-.708z" fill="currentColor"></path></svg>](https://www.scrum.org/resources).

## **Digital documents, spreadsheets, and presentations** 

You will complete activities using a variety of digital documents, spreadsheets, and presentation templates. These templates align with the document types that project managers often use to create, edit, and collaborate with their team and organization. Digital documents make it easy to collaborate in real time and stay organized.
