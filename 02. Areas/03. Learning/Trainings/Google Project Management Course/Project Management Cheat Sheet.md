## Perform a cost analysis
[[2. Project Initiation - Module 1 - Perform a cost analysis]]

Use guided questions for a cost-benefit analysis
- What value will this project create? 
- How much money could this project save our organization? 
- How much money will it bring in from existing customers?
- How much time will it save? 
- How will it improve the customer experience?

Determine the costs of a project:
- How much time will people have to spend on this project?
- What are the one-time costs?
- Are there any ongoing costs?
- What about long-term costs? 

Intangible benefits
- **Customer satisfaction**. Will the project increase customer retention, causing them to spend more on the company’s products or services? 
- **Employee satisfaction**. Is the project likely to improve employee morale, reducing turnover? 
- **Employee productivity**. Will the project reduce employee’s overtime hours, saving the company money?
- **Brand perception**. Is the project likely to improve the company’s brand perception and recognition, attracting more customers or providing a competitive advantage?

Compute the ROI of a project:
* ROI = (Gains - Cost) / Cost
