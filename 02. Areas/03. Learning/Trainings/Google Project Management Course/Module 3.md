* Team roles can vary. This happens if the company is limited in size. 
* Project sponsor: Accountable for the project and makes sure the project is delivered according to the expectations, to the business. They will communicate directly with managers and key stakeholders. 
* Team members are the heart of the operation. 
* Customers: Who will get value from a landed project. 
* Customers will need to define the requirements. 
* Users are the people who will use the product that the project produces
* Stakeholders: Anyone in the project who have an interest in the project completion. 
* Secondary stakeholders can be contractors, they are secondary impacted by the project. 
* Project manager: The person who plans, oversees and organizes the whole project.

## Stakeholders analysis
[[Prioritizing stakeholders and generating their buy-in Coursera]]
* Primary: People who will benefit directly from the project's success
* Secondary: People who will indirectly be impacted by the project's success

1. Make a list of all the stakeholders the project impacts
2. Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder
3. Find ways to participate and ways to involve them

Influence: Determine which power a stakeholder has and how much of their actions influences the project outcome. 
Interests: How much are the needs of stakeholders impacted by the outcome.

Use a power grid to position stakeholders by their level of influence and interest in the project. 

4 groups of stakeholders
* Key Player: Closely partnering with them
* Higher influence and lower interest: Consult with them and meet their needs. 
* Low influence but high interest: showing consideration. 
* Low influence and low interest: Just monitor them. 

![[Pasted image 20241118081017.png]]

Create a steering committee with people from high influence and high interest. 

For some stakeholders you need to meet every day. 

For others, only periodic meetings is ok. 

Stakeholders' buyin. Process of involving people in decision-making to reach a consensus in the organization's future. 

**High Impact Stakeholders: Make sure they are looped in, that we show how the project will support their goal. 

If you have one stakeholder only you have to loop this stakeholder in as frequently as possible. Send reminders and hold meetings. 
Larger project with numerous stakeholders: They will not be as involved. 
SH who needs to make decisions about the project: Send updates early on. 


## Prioritizing Stakeholders and Generating their Buy-in

* Keep stakeholders organized to know when and how to involve them
* Make a list of stakeholders: Who is invested in the project? Who is impacted? Who contributes to it?
* Determine the level of interest and influence for each stakeholder. THe higher the interest and influence, the more we should prioritize their needs. 
* Determine the ability from stakeholders to participate
	* Active stakeholders: More opinions and touchpoints
	* Passive staekholders: high-level updates and not involved in day-to-day
* Forming a steering committee during projects. Collection of key stakeholders who have a high level of power and interest in the project. 

### Visualizing the analysis
* Use a power grid.

## Examples of questions to ask stakeholders
* What are the expectations for this project?
* Where do you think I'll get support? Meet resistance?
* What can I clarify for you? Do you have concerns?
* What does project success mean to you?
* How would you like to be involved in the project?
* Can you share insights about your experience with customers?

## Complete a stakeholder analysis and a power grid

Classifies stakeholders along the dimensions:
* Stakeholder
* Power / Influence
* Interest: High, Medium, Low
* Engagement: High, Medium, Low
* Impact
* Role


## RACI Chart

* Defines roles and responsibilities for individuals and teams
* Creates clear roles for each team member
* 4 types of implication
	* Responsible: Those doing the work to complete the task
	* Accountable: Those making sure the work gets done
	* Consulted: Those giving feedback, SME, decision-makers
	* Informed: Those needing to know the final decisions or that the tasks are complete.

1. Who is involved in the project. Use roles rather than names. 
2. Write tasks or deliverables on the left
3. Who is responsible, accountable... 


![[Pasted image 20241128082820.png]]
## RACI Chart
* Goal: Identify each one's goal in the project
* **R**: Responsible: who gets the work done
* **A**: Accountable: who makes sure the work is done
* **C**: Consulted: who gives input or feedback on work
* **I**: Informed: who needs to know the outcome

**Pro tip**: You could end up with a large number of team members and stakeholders who are placed in the “informed” role. If so, make sure that you have a plan to keep them informed that is not labor-intensive. Something as easy as view-only access to your project plan or meeting notes could prevent you from having to create separate communications along the way.

## Getting the most out of a RACI Chart
* Determining who is accountable, responsible, consulted and informed allows to keep control of the stakeholders roles in the project
* Go back to the chart and tally the number of Rs assigned to each stakeholders
* Using RACI charts to determine responsibility of tasks can help mitigate points of failure and not create silos. 

### Putting the RACI into practice
1. Sharing the chart with the sponsors and stakeholders to get buy-in and sign-off. 
2. Getting stakeholder buy-in = getting clear expectations and making sure everyone is aligned on the responsibilities. 
3. Document the acknowledgement of the team and sh through project charter, meeting notes and the RACI Chart. 
4. Getting buy-in, checking with the team allows to avoid pitfalls. 
5. RACI chart is useful for large projects or projects with a lot of stakeholders. 
6. Even if not using it, you will have a better understanding of it and the efforts will contribute to the project manageent experience. 

## Why Projects Fail: Initiations Missteps

### Unclear expectations
- What is the end goal?
- What are the expected deliverables and schedule?
- What is the budget?
- Who are the stakeholders?
Without directions, we can never reach our destination. 

### Unrealistic Expectations
* Important to agree to the requirements of a project before agreeing to deadlines. 
* Don't commit to firm dates when initiating the projects to avoid setting unrealistic expectations

### Miscommunication
* Information should be communicated in a timely manner
* Information should include pertinent information (risks, decisions made, scope changes)
* Information should be sent to the correct stakeholders
* Conduct a stakeholder analysis and utilize a raci chart to understand which stakeholder should be kept informed
* Setting expectations on how communications should occur. 
* Understanding communication needs of team and stakeholders. 
* Strong communication suste,
	* Writing
	* Face-to-face
	* Emails
	* Phone conversation. 
* Lack of resources
* Resources: Team members, budget and materials
* Incorrect calculation of expenses. 

### Scope Creep
* Defining the scope upfront
	* What is and is not uncluded
	* Cost associated
	* Schedule required to complete the work
* Delivering the impact of changes should be done on the schedule, budget and quality. 
* Everything should then be documented in the initiation phase. 
* Have a plan to handle scope creep. Clarify who has the authority to approve scope changes. 
* Take some time to clarify expectations, around communication methods
	* Communication methods
	* Resources
	* Scope
