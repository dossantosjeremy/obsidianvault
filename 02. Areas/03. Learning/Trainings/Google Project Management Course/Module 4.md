# Resources
* What are the things we need to succeed in the project
	* Budget
	* People
	* Material
* Figure out the goals for the project
* Then figure out the resources you need for each goal
* Figure out the resources before the project gets rolling. 
* Plan resources early so that everyone has everything they need to work on time and on budget. 

### Resources
#### Budget
- Estimate amount of money needed to accomplish the project
- Buying a material or software 
- Hiring vendors
- Doing marketing
During the initiation: Figure out the tasks that need to be done. Ask questions to figure out the costs. Like are there any taxes, extra fees? 
Source and compare proposals from vendors. Figure out incoming costs. Figure out money moving in and out of the project. 
Include the budget in the project charter 

#### Team of people accomplishing the project

#### Materials
What is needed to get the project done. 

How to organize these resources? 

#### Tools
- Aids that make it easier for project managers to organize resources and work. 
- Track tasks
- Manage budgets
- Collaborate with teammates
- Tools: Productivity like google docs
- Work management software like Asana

#### Example of a project
* Remember the project goal
* Do some research to figure out the cost of launching a new service
* Budget for specific tools like a project management software
* Build a realistic budget. 
* Figure out who is working with you. 
* Make a list of people who is working with you. 

## Managing resources to get the job done

### Budget
* Important to control the budget for project management as well. 
* Aspects of the budget to take into account
	* Team: Cost of people performing the work
	* Services: Vendors helping with the project
	* Materials: Tangible items purchased to complete the project

### People
* Make sure you have the commitment and buy-in on the number of hours it takes for resources to complete their tasks
* Best partners: People interested in the goals of the project or the ones interested in the project's work

### Materials
* They can be tangible or intangible

### Takeaway
* Interview stakeholders *


## Project documentation video
* Important to keep track of project decisions
* Keep track of project goals and deliverables
* Choose the right people to add to a team
* Documentation is an important part of a project manager role
* Clear and consistent documentation: Ensures transparency

**Clear documentation:**
* What problem are we trying to solve
* What are the project goals
* What are the scope and deliverables
* Who are the project stakeholders
* What resources does the team need?
* Documentation helps preserve decisions made early on in the project. 
* Can serve as a reference point for people joining later
* It needs to be a formal presentation: email, presentation, digital document
* Documenting decisions can help uncover tasks, timelines or costs
* Can provide a historical of the decisions taken during the project
* Apply the lessons learned later in the future

## Project Proposals and Charters

* Project proposal: A form of documentation starting the project
* Persuading stakeholders that the project should begin. 
* A senior leader usually creates the proposal. 
* Your task is not to create the proposal but to keep track of the proposal's progress. 
* A formal proposal: Document, email, or just an email to get everyone onboard with the idea. 
* Project charter: Formal document that clearly defines the project and necessary details to reach its goals. 
* Be organised: Set up a framework for what needs to be done and communicating these details to others. 
* **Project proposal**: Kicks Off the initiation phase by influencing and persuading the company to move forward with the project. 
* **Project charter**: Comes at the end of the initiation phase. Its goals is to clearly define the key details of the project
* Proposal only used at the earliest stages. 
* Charter serves as a point of reference throughout the project. 
* Project charter: Making clear that the benefits of the project outweighs the costs. 


### Cost benefit analysis
* How much value does this project create?
* How much business value is created
* How much money is saved?
* How much time people will have to spend on this project?
* Charter helps ensure you and stakeholders agree on the details of the project 
* After stakeholders have reviewed and agreed to the project charter, you can move forward. 
* Creating a project charter is a best practice to make sure everyone agrees before moving forward. 
* As a project manager you need to reviewe and update the project charter throughout the project.

## Project charter
* Charter: Here to make sure that me and stakeholders agree on the details of the project. 
* Project approval: Management is supportive. 
* Project charter: Formatted in a few ways depending on the organization. 
* The charter needs to include different things based on who it is destined to. 
* It is a living document: It should evolve as the project evolves. 
* As a project manager you should review and update the project charter throughout the process. 


## Project Charters: Elements and Formats

* Defines the project
* Outlines the necessary details for the project to reach its goals.
* Project's goals, values, benefits and details
* Make sure you are aligned with strategic goals
* It is important to incorporate the right amount of detail and omit miscellaneous elements
* Develop project charter with groups
* Project charters include the following
	* - introduction/project summary
	* goals/objectives
	* business case/benefits and costs
	* project team
	* scope
	- success criteria
	- major requirements or key deliverables
	- budget
	- schedule/timeline or milestones
	- constraints and assumptions
	- risks
	- OKRs
	- approvals

## Create a project charter
* Securing approvals from stakeholders and moving forward
* Many templates available online
* Name of the project
* Executive summary. 
* Project goals. They should be smart. 
* Add the deliverables. They should be tangible. 
* Business case: Why are we doing this. 
* Business case is supported by the cost-benefit analysis:
	* Improved customer satisfaction. 
	* Increase in revenue
* Costs
* Benefits should always outweigh the costs. 
* Project scope: Agreed upon understanding of what is included or excluded 
* Project Team
	* Project Sponsor
	* Project Lead
	* Project Team
	* Additional Stakeholders
* Measuring Success

## The benefits of project planning

During the initiation phase, the project manager is gathering all information from stakeholders to get the project approved and moving. 

1. Project manager gets assigned. 
2. Goals of the project, scope, deliverables have to be approved. 
3. Team members get assigned to the project. 
4. Stakeholders need to sign off on the project charter. 

Planning is important for any type of project, large or small. 

We determine the processes and workflows to meet the goals. We can think about past projects' experiences. But also think about new ways to get results. Every project is different. 

Planning: 
* Helps to map out the full project
* Helps to understand the work needed to achieve your goals. 
* Also helps to coordinate efforts and timelines with other teams, contractors and vendors. 
* Identify and prepare for risks that could impact the project. 
* Delay in the timeline, change of a primary stakeholder
* Planning gives ways to address risks in advance and mitigate those risks. 
* Helps to get buy-in from key members of the `rpject team. 
* Buyin means you are getting support for your plans. 
* Demonstrating stakeholders that you are about to start a project with a detailed plan. 
* Planning together creates a shared understanding among all parties in a project. 

## Launch the planning phase

* Second phase of a project lifecycle. 
* There is a lot to consider. 
* Project plans do not have to be perfect the very first time. 

### 3 things are worked out during this phase
* Schedule: Timeline of the project, start date, end date, and things that happen in between. 
	* We use time estimation techniques. 
	* If you want to launch something by X, then the planning should include important dates.
	* When working through a potential schedule for a project, you should include several key dates. The dates may include important constraints from vendors, kickoffs dates, and when to complete certain tasks. Make sure to include a target date for the product (menu) launch, and validate that with the client. Remember, the schedule isn’t permanent. While you would like to stick to the schedule as closely as possible, it may change.
* Budget: Account for the total cost for the project. 
	* Cost of designing and launching a web page, hiring a vendor...
	* Call vendors and get quotes of items you may need to purchase. Include any pay for teammates or fees for outside consultants or service-based vendors. Include any software costs you may need to help you organize and manage your project. What if the project is delayed—are any fees associated with the delay?
* Risk management plan:
	* Searching for possible problems and planning ahead to mitigate those risks. 
	* Searching where trouble might occur. 
	* Where schedule might offtrack?
	* Where might the budget exceed the estimates?
	* Budget items that are likely to increase in cost. Think about days off for team members, and consider any holidays or vacation days. What about tasks and deliverables that could delay the project? Feedback from stakeholders could also cause delays.
* For instance, if the tasks would lead to something that is to be delivered in way more time -> We can try to negotiate a new deadline or adjust the scope down. 
* You first need to have the whole team onboard


# Planning a klickoff meeting
* A project kickoff meeting: First meeting in which a project team comes together to ground everyone in a shared vision, gain a shared understanding of the project's goals and scope, and to understand each person's individual role within the team. 
* Who's invited?
	* Team members identified in a RACI Chart, created during initiation phase
	* RACI Chart: Define roles and responsibilities for individuals and teams to ensure work gets done efficiently.

		* Set aside 15 minutes for questions within the group. 
		* Make sure the project benefits from diversity of thoughts, experiences and ideas 
			* In addition to sharing questions out loud, we can invite teammates to share their questions in a live document. 
			* Ask teams their confidence level on a topic on a scale of 1-5, from 1 not confident at all, to 5 extremely confident. Asking them what we can do to change their confidence level. 
			* Reputation as a project manager is critical to remove roadblocks. 

**Summary**

# Understanding tasks and milestones

Important point within a project that indicates progress and usually signifies the completion of a deliverable or phase of the project. 
Keeping track of milestones ensures the project is on schedule to meet its goals. 

Project task: Activity that should be accomplished within a set period of time. 

To achieve a milestone, a team needs to accomplish multiple tasks. 

Milestones are important points within the project schedule. 

Project tasks are activities that need to be accomplished within a set period of time. 

Milestones and project tasks are interconnected. Tasks ladder up to project milestones, which are crucial for project tracking. 

# Importance of milestones
- It is really important to break the project down, piece by piece. 
- Setting milestones gives a clear understanding of the amount of work a project will require. 
- Setting milestones helps to chunk the project into manageable steps. 
- If we break down a project into milestones, and milestones into tasks, we will have a true estimate of the amount of work that needs to be done. 
- They also help keep the project on track.  
	- When we set milestones, we set clear deadlines for when project deliverables need to be completed. 
	- Then, we can look back at these deadlines to make sure we progress at this pace
- Help uncover areas where we might need to adjust scope, timelines or resources. 
- E.g. if we realise a milestone will require more tasks than anticipated we can ask the stakeholders to reduce the scope down. 
- Reaching milestones can really help motivate the team and showcase big projects to stakeholders. 
- Milestones also serve to highlight our progress to stakeholders. They give us an opportunity to show the work completed so far. 
- Milestones must be completed on time and in sequential order. 
- If we cannot reach milestones, the team might need to work overtime or add additional resources to catchup. 

# How to set milestones for the project


* Evaluate a project as a whole
* Refer to the project charter to identify project goals
* Make a list of what the team needs to do to achieve the goal. 
* The big items that indicate progress are the milestones. 
* These are items that signifiy the completion of a project deliverable or a phase in the project. 
* Smaller items are tasks (e.g. what the stakeholders do not need to review) 
* Some projects will have many milestones and others only 1-3
* Assign each milestone a deadline
* Get an estimate of how long tasks will take from teammates. 
* Also ask the stakeholders when do they expect to get the deliverables

## Setting milestones Best practices Coursera

* A **project task** is an activity that needs to be accomplished within a set period of time and is assigned to one or more individuals for completion. The work of a project is broken down into many different project tasks.
- A **project** **milestone** is an important point within the project schedule that usually signifies the completion of a major deliverable. Milestones are significant checkpoints in your project, and keeping track of them helps ensure that your project is on schedule to meet its goals.

## **Set tasks to identify milestones**

Setting tasks can help you clearly define milestones. You can do this in two ways:

1. **Top-down scheduling:** In this approach, the project manager lays out the higher-level milestones, then works to break down the effort into project tasks. The project manager works with their team to ensure that all tasks are captured.
2. **Bottom-up scheduling:** In this approach, the project manager looks at all of the individual tasks that need to be completed and then rolls those tasks into manageable chunks that lead to a milestone.

**Integrate Milestones** 
- Not a consistent number of milestones in every project. 
- Try to set milestones for the most important events in the project. 
- Pinpoint where in the project you will achieve major goals and make those points in the milestones. 

**Milestones Setting Pitfalls
* Don't set too many milestones
* Milestones should represent moments in time, and to map out how to get to those moments, you need to assign smaller tasks to each milestone. 
* Don't list tasks and milestones separately. Tasks and milestones should be visible altogether in one place, such as a project plan.
* Most project will have at least one milestone and several smaller tasks 
* Set clearly defined distinct tasks and milestones
* Integrate them into the schedule
* Use a tool to visualize them together.

# Milestones vs Tasks

- milestone: moment in time, significant step in the project. Can be defined in a top down or a bottom up approach. 
	- top down: define milestones first and then identify what tasks will be inside the milestone.
	- Bottom up: identify the set of tasks to do and roll them up in milestones. 
- The number of milestones will depend on each project. There is never too many or too little milestones. 
- Dont have too many milestones because then their importance is challenged. 
- Don't mistake tasks for milestones. 
- Milestones are moments in time and tasks: assignments per milestones
- Tasks and milestonesd should be visible in one place, such as a project plan. 
- 1. Set clearly defined, distinct tasks and milestones 2. integrate milestones into project schedule 3. use a tool that helps to visualize milestones and tasks together. 


## Work breakdown structure

In the previous video, you were introduced to a major component of the planning phase: the creation of a **work breakdown structure** (WBS). A WBS is a deliverable-oriented breakdown of a project into smaller components. It’s a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project into a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed. 

A thorough WBS gives you a visual representation of a project and the tasks required to deliver each milestone. It makes it easier to understand all of the essential project tasks, such as estimating costs, developing a schedule, assigning roles and responsibilities, and tracking progress. Think of each piece of information as part of the overall project puzzle—you can’t successfully navigate through the tasks without understanding how they all fit together. For instance, many smaller tasks may ladder up to a larger task or milestone.

![A WBS chart with the project title at the top, followed by milestones and then tasks below the milestones](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Scu_G9LBQnaLvxvSwQJ2tg_16120ff266654e17b1a393b519ff82f1_WBS.jpg?expiry=1735430400000&hmac=TdPdqxmEukHAZsJfm3yb5Lm9cU9wF4w2k3Oh69SPVGE)

## **Steps to build a WBS**

As a reminder, here are three main steps to follow when creating a WBS: 

- **Start with the high-level, overarching project picture. Brainstorm with your team to list the major deliverables and milestones.** Example: Imagine you are planning a company event. Your major milestones might include categories like “secure venue,”  “finalize guest logistics,” and “establish agenda.”
    

- **Identify the tasks that need to be performed in order to meet those milestones.** Example: You could break a milestone like “secure venue” down into tasks like “research venues,” “tour and decorate space,” “make down payment,” and so on. 
    

- **Examine those tasks and break them down further into sub-tasks.** Example: You could break down a task like “tour and decorate space” further into sub-tasks like “organize decorating committee,” “purchase decorations,” “assign decorating responsibilities,” and so on.

## Create a work breakdown structure
- a tool that sorts the milestones and tasks of a project in a hierarchy, in the order they need to be completed. 
- A common eay is to create a tree diagram
- At the top: name of the project
- Then we break it down into milestones
- Third level: each milestone is broken down into tasks
- We would not input this diagram into the project plan. 
- Rather we would put the output of our tasks in our spreadsheet
- Should have a set of discrete project tasks that ladder up to the milestones
- Be able to assign those tasks to members of the team
- To assign tasks to 2 or more people with the same role, assign depending on the familiarity.
- Consider each teammate workload
- Ensure no one has more work than what they can handle.
- Ensure teammates are clear in their assigned tasks
- Manage tasks in asana. 
- As a best practice: good to use each task as a word.
- Be sure to add an assignee and due date of the task. 
- Add tasks details to avoid miscommunication. 
- Comment on the work related to the task. 
- Assigning tasks creates a sense of personal responsibility. Each one will own the task. It makes them feel more invested
- Keeps the team motivated 
- Encourage teammates to support each other on their tasks.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Identify the overarching goal
2. Identify the milestones for the goal
3. Identify the tasks inside each milestone
4. Identify subtasks inside each task


## How to plan for projects
- planning for projects: you take a step back and you ask what is the problem we need to solve
- What are we trying to build and who are we trying to build it for
- What are the risks, mitigation plans
- We look at timing: what is the timeline we need to hit and are we ok with the timeline
- What work needs to be done and is this in line with the timeline
- Testing and what success is going to look like
- What is the target, what metrics so we expect to get
- Planning sets the tone for what we are trying to do together
- What are our goals, what is success going to look like
- We want to set the tone that we are all in this together 


## Building a project plan and making realistic time estimates

 - project plan
- Use time estimation techniques to build an accurate project schedule
- Use tools and practices to build out a project plan

## project plan
- helps to document goals, tasks and milestones
- At the center is the project schedule
- Most plans have these 5 basic elements:
	- Tasks: activities to be acoxmplished in a set period of time. Assigned to people in the team according to their role. 
	- Milestones: important step in a schedule that will indicate progress. Signifiy the completion of a project deliverable. 
	- People: each team member undersrands their role. Frees up time to manage the project 
	- Documentation: documents like the raci chart. Also link the charter: outlines the project charter: outlines the details needed to reach goals. Also budget and risk management plan
	- Time: estimated time spent on the project. Dates when you start and complete tasks. Also includes dates of milestones. Also includes start and end dates of the project. 
	- How to estimate how long it takes




![[Pasted image 20241227094818.png]]

## making realistic time estimates
- project manager responsible for identifying and assigning tasks
- Estimating how long they will take to complete
- Time estimation: with the help of the team. Time estimation is a prediction of the total amount time required to complete a task
- Effort estimation: a prediction of the amount and difficulty of active work required to complete a task. 
- Effort estimation: estimation of time it will take someone to complete a task
- Time estimation is the estimate of time for a whole task, from start to finish.
- That includes waiting timeS 
- Use the idle time effectively to do other things. 
- Underestimating effort estimates happen when you underestimate the amount of time it takes to complete a task
- Underestimating erfort is optimism
- Too much optimism hijders potential risk that will affect completion of the plan
- Always a possibility for setbacks
- Communicate to teammates
- They will have the most realistic understanding of how long a task should take.
- Subtasks: smaller tasks required to complete a larger task
- Asking for teammates for the time it takes will yield better estimates
- Gently pushback on the estimates. 
- Estimates are just that, estimates 
- Tasks delays happen
- There is a tool, called a buffer, extra time, added to the end of a task or a project to account for unexpected slowdownsor delays in work progress. 
- Buffers provide some leeway
- We can create tasks buffers and project buffers
- Tasks buffers: extra time for specific tasks. Used primarily for tasks that are out of the project team control
- Adding buffer to every tasks could add too much delay to the project schedule. This is when adding project buffers come in handy 
- Project buffer: add extra time to the overall project schedule. 


# Creating a project plan: Tools and Templates
Source: [[Creating a project plan tools and templates Raw]]

* Captures the scope and time it takes to complete a project. 
* Essentially the project's blueprint
* Activities and milestones the team needs to complete to successfully complete the project
* Templates will depend on each company. 
* For a simple project: use a spreadsheet. For a more complex project: use a project management software. 
* Assign task IDs and names. It helps to find them again when needed. 
* Task duration: amount of time estimated to complete a task. 
* Start and finish dates: Helps to track if we are progressing on the time or not. 
* Who is responsible for what. Include team members' roles and responsibilities. 
  Assign an owner to each task. 

# Use a spreadsheet
* Excellent tool for project plans. 
* Projects that are less complex. 
* Projects that have a clear assignment of tasks. 
* Requires a lot of manual input. 
* You like the control that spreadsheets provide.

**Work management tools**
* Smartsheet
* Asana
* Jira
* Trello

**Tool used**
* Helps to collect and track project details
* Manage schedule
* Visualize how the project is progressing

## Introduction to Kanban Boards
[[Introduction to Kanban Boards]]

* Tasks associated with a project are written on cards. 
* Cards are placed in columns. 
* This is a visual tool to manage tasks and workflow
* Agile project management approach: iterative approach to managing projects that focuses on continuous releases and incorporates customer feedback with every iteration. 
* Kanban board: More suitable for project teams that work in agile. 

## Kanban board
* Gives quick visual understanding of work details. 
* Provides critical task information
* Facilitate handoff between stakeholders and testing or between team members who work on related tasks
* Help capturing metrics and improving workflows

### Building the board
* Gather
	* Tasks
	* Statuses
	* Dates
	* Durations
* Rows (teams or person) to visualize who is working on what. 

**Content of cards**
* Title and unique identifier (e.g. task ID)
* Description of the work (be short here)
* Estimation of the effort: Estimate the amount of work to complete the task (small - medium - large). 
* Who is assigned to the task: Ideally one person per card
* Start date
* Blocked days
* Finished date (when the date is supposed to be finished)

### Software
* Asana
* Trello
