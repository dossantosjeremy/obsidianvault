  ![[TEMPLATE - SMART Goals.pdf]]

![[Summary - Course 2 Module 2 Smart Goal]]

Smart goals should be:
- Specific: No ambiguity
- Measurable: With actual metrics that help determine when the objective is met. 
- Attainable: The objective should be realistic
- Relevant: The goal fits the organization strategic plan
- Time-Bound: The projec tteam documents a date to achieve the goal
- Measurable means we assess the success of the project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics. Example: Dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders. 
- Not every measure will have value for the project. We should always determine what feature has the highest 
- Example: 
	- Make a career change
	- Set the goal to complete the google career certificate
	- Meausre the success of the goal: After completing the entire program, we receive a certificate which will be a tangible outcome. 
	- Attainable: Accomplish one course per month. 
	- Relevant: It supports the desire to make a career change. 
	- Final goal: After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next six months.

**C2M2: Activity - Define and Determine Smart Project Goals**
**Takeaways**
- **Specific:** The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 
- **Measurable:** Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
- **Attainable:** The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
- **Relevant:** The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
- **Time-bound:** The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

You may see variations on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. (For example, you may see “actionable” or “achievable” instead of “attainable” or “realistic” instead of “relevant.”) However, the general intent of each of these terms—to make sure the goal is within reach—is always similar.

  

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the **M** in SMART, which stands for **measurable**. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics

  

**SMART goals: Making goals meaningful**

  

In this lesson you are learning to define and create measurable project goals and deliverables. Now, let's focus on SMART goals.

**Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant,** and **Time-bound (SMART)** goals are very helpful for ensuring project success. As you start your career in project management, you may not directly set the project goals, but you should be able to clarify and understand them. SMART goals help you see the full scope of a goal, determine its feasibility, and clearly define project success in concrete terms. 

Let’s recap what we discussed in the previous video by taking a look at a breakdown of the criteria for SMART goals below: 

- **Specific:** The objective has no ambiguity for the project team to misinterpret. 
- **Measurable:** Metrics help the project team determine when the objective is met.
- **Attainable:** The project team agrees the objective is realistic.
- **Relevant:** The goal fits the organization’s strategic plan and supports the project charter.
- **Time-bound:** The project team documents a date to achieve the goal.

You may see variations on what each letter in the “SMART” acronym stands for. (For example, you may see “actionable” or “achievable” instead of “attainable” or “realistic” instead of “relevant.”) However, the general intent of each of these terms—to make sure the goal is within reach—is always similar.

**Focusing on the "M" in SMART**

Let’s take a moment to zoom in on the **M** in SMART, which stands for **measurable**. Having measurable goals allows you to assess the success of your project based on quantifiable or tangible metrics, such as dollar amounts, number of outputs, quantities, etc. Measurable goals are important because they leave little room for confusion around expectations from stakeholders. 

Not every metric will have value, so you will have to determine which metrics make sense for the project. For example, measuring how many meetings the software engineers on your project attend on a weekly basis may not be the most valuable metric for a productivity goal. Alternatively, you might measure other aspects of the engineers’ productivity, such as a particular number of features created per engineer or a specific number of issues flagged per day.

**Defining a SMART goal**

Let’s explore an example related to making a personal goal measurable. Imagine you are looking to make a career change, and you set a goal to complete a Google Career Certificate. You can **measure** the success of this goal because after completing the entire program, you will receive a certificate—a tangible outcome.

Now, let’s determine how to make the remaining elements of this goal SMART. In this example, your **specific** goal is to attain a Google Career Certificate. You can make this goal **attainable** by deciding that you will complete one course per month. This goal is **relevant** because it supports your desire to make a career change. Finally, you can make this goal **time-bound** by deciding that you will complete the program within six months.

After defining each of these components, your SMART goal then becomes: Obtain a Google Career Certificate by taking one course per month within the next six months.

**Key takeaway**

Determining metrics can be extremely helpful in capturing statuses, successes, delays, and more in a project. As a project manager, identifying meaningful metrics can help move the project toward its goal. Additionally, by defining each element of a project goal to make it SMART, you can determine what success means for that goal and how to achieve it.

.

**Activity Overview**

In this activity, you will analyze a scenario to identify project goals. Then, you will write the goals using SMART criteria. 

As a reminder, SMART goals must be:

- **Specific:**
- **Measurable**
- **Attainable:**
- **Relevant**
- **Time-bound**

Be sure to complete this activity before moving on. The next course item will provide you with a completed exemplar to compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity.

**Note:** This activity requires completion, but the completed document does NOT need to be submitted. All you need to do is mark the question at the end of this activity "Yes" when you've completed the following assignment.

**Scenario**

  

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Office Green, LLC, is a commercial landscaping company that specializes in plant decor for offices and other businesses. The company is getting ready to introduce its new Plant Pals service, which will provide high-volume customers with small, low-maintenance plants for their desks. You are the project manager assigned to manage the Plant Pals launch.

Office Green’s main goal for this project is: “Increase revenue by 5% by the end of the year by rolling out a new service that provides office plants to high-volume clients.”

You recently met with the project sponsor (the Director of Product) to discuss two additional goals for the Plant Pals project:

1. Boost Office Green’s brand awareness
2. Raise Office Green’s customer retention rate

In order to help your team achieve these two additional project goals, you need to turn them into SMART goals. The notes from your meeting with the Director of Product are below. You can use this information to create SMART goals:

- Office Green’s customer retention rate was 80% last year, but the CEO wants that number to increase by at least 10% this year.
- Last year, 70% of customers who left Office Green for competitors said they did so because they wanted more extensive services. When surveyed, 85% of existing customers expressed an interest in Plant Pals.
- The Vice President of Customer Success expects Office Green to achieve a customer satisfaction rating of over 90% this year—a slight increase over last year. The rating has stayed between 85%-90% for the last five years.
- The company plans to create an Operations and Training plan for Plant Pals to improve on existing customer service standards and boost efficiency.
- Office Green will promote the new service with a new marketing and sales strategy, a redesigned website with a new Plant Pals landing page, and a print catalog. 
- With the publicity around the launch, Office Green projects that their customer base will grow by at least 15%.
- Website traffic has dipped slightly over the past three years, from 15K to 13K visits each month. The Marketing Manager wants unique page visits to increase by at least 2K each month by the end of the year, which is in line with the results of prior marketing campaigns.
- The project is scheduled to launch by the end of the third quarter. The project team will continue to collect data on the project’s progress through the rest of the year and assess how well it has met its goals at the end of the fourth quarter. (It is currently the start of Q1.)

**Step 2: Revise the goals to be SMART**

The template contains the two additional project goals for Plant Pals, neither of which meets all the SMART criteria:

1. “Office Green will boost brand awareness”
2. “Office Green will raise their customer retention rate”

Turn these two goals into SMART goals using the information from the scenario above. Write the revised goals next to **SMART Goal One** and **SMART Goal Two**. Your goals should be complete, but brief—one or two sentences is enough.

For example, here is a goal that’s missing some of the SMART criteria:

“Office Green will soon create an app to help customers care for their plants.”

That’s not a bad start, but it isn’t specific, measurable, or time-bound. Here’s the same goal, rewritten as a SMART goal:

“Office Green will create an app that offers tips and reminders to help customers care for their plants. The app will be completed within 18 months and be compatible with 100% of the types of plants Office Green sells.”

**Step 3: Explain what makes each goal SMART**

Now that you’ve rewritten the goals, explain what makes them SMART by answering the following questions:

1. What makes the goal **specific**? Does it provide enough detail to avoid ambiguity?
2. What makes the goal **measurable**? Does it include metrics to gauge success?
3. What makes the goal **attainable**? Is it realistic given available time and resources?
4. What makes the goal **relevant**? Does it support project or business objectives?
5. What makes the goal **time-bound**?Does it include a timeline or deadline?

Be specific in your answers. For instance, the plant care app SMART goal is:

- **Specific:** The team knows what they’re building: an app that helps users care for their plants and reminds them to do so. 
- **Measurable:** The app will be complete when it includes 100% of the plant types Office Green sells.
- **Attainable:** The company has the knowledge, time, resources to build the app. 
- **Relevant:** Office Green’s business model relies on customers caring for their plants successfully. 
- **Time-bound:** The goal includes an 18-month timeframe.

If you find that either goal does not meet all the SMART criteria, try revising it and answering the questions again.

**What to Include in Your Response**

  

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed SMART goals activity:

- Goal one is rewritten to meet all the SMART criteria 
- Goal two is rewritten to meet all the SMART criteria 
- There is an explanation for why each rewritten goal is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.
