# Objectives and Key Results
* Objectives and Key results communicate a goal and a metric. 
* Objectives: Defines what needs to be achieved. 
* Key Results: What are the measurable outcomes. *

# Communicating and tracking OKRs
* Sharing the OKRs: As soon as you have the OKRs formalized, share them with the team so that there is a shared understanding. 
* Define who would be accountable for each OKR (assigning owners)*

# Setting OKRs
* Evaluating the achievement of an OKR can be done in several ways
* With a yes/no approach, with a scale, with percentages... 
* Each objective has several key results and usually we compute the average across all key results
* Google's approach is to grade the accomplishment of key results on a scale of 0 - 1. 
* A sweet spot to attain an OKR is 60% ' 70%. 
* lower than 60% would be considered a fail. 
* Higher than 70% would mean that the objective was too easy. 

# Regular checkpoints
* It is useful to have regular checkpoints:
	* Monthly with the manager and the rest of the team to evaluate progress
	* Every quarter to give an evaluation of the progress*
