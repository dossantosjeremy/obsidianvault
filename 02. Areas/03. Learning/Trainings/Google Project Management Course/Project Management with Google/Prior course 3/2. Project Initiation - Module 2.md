**Determining project goals and deliverables**

  

  

- Goals: What needs to be done
- What you need to accomplish, how you will do it and how to measure success
- The project goal is the desired outcome of a project, what you are asked to do and what you are trying to achieve: For instance increase the response time of customers by X%. 
- Goals: Need to be clear and specific
- We need to be confident that we know when they are reached. 
- Goals tell you what you need to achieve and how you will do it. 
- To clarify, we can add the phrasing “by …” 
- Goals: Should be specific and measurable
- To have more clarity we can ask directly to stakeholders. 
- We should all be clear on the project goal before starting any project. 

  

  

**Deliverables**

- They are produced and presented at the end of a project. 
- Common deliverables are reports. 
- It is important to have everyone aligned on the shared vision of goals and deliverables. 

  

**Steps to follow** 

- Refine the goals with the stakeholders
- Turn these goals into SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-Bound)
- Assess stakeholders’ power and influence. 
- Assign roles and responsibilities
