# Synthesis - Using OKRs to evaluate progress

## Tracking
* Track the success of each project with OKR: Objectives and Key Results. 
* Share the OKRs with the team
* Share them in a digital document, on a website... 
* Assign an owner to each key result. 

## Grading OKRs
* Several grades systems can be done: traffic light, yes or no, 1 to 10... 
* Google has a 0 to 1 notation system. 1 means it has been achieved. In between means it is in progress. 
* It is important to set goals that are challenging but not too much. 
* For instance, a sweet spot might be 0,6 or 0,7. 
* If you have several parts inside of an objective, you should grade them independently and average them. 

## Communicate regularly
* Schedule regular check ins with the team to track progress. *
