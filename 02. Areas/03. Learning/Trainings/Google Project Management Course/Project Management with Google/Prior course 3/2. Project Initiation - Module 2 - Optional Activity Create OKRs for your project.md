*This practice activity is an opportunity for you to apply the concepts that you learned throughout the course. We provide a completed example activity so you can compare and contrast your work and grow as a project manager.*

To pass this optional activity, you must receive 100%, or 1 out of 1 point, by reviewing or completing the activity below. You can learn more about the graded and practice items in the [Course OverviewOpens in a new tab](https://www.coursera.org/learn/project-initiation-google/supplement/CQ4he/course-2-overview).

## Activity Overview

In this activity, you will practice creating OKRs (objectives and key results) for a project. OKRs combine a goal and a metric to determine a measurable outcome. Objectives define what needs to be achieved and describe a desired outcome, while key results define how you will measure that outcome.

As a project manager, creating OKRs can help you clarify both your overall project goals and the deliverables you’ll need to accomplish those goals. You can also create project-level OKRs to help motivate your team.

When you finish the activity, we'll take you through an exemplar of the completed assignment that you can compare to your own work. You will not be able to access the exemplar until you have completed this activity. Be sure to review these exemplars carefully, so you know what you did well and how you can improve next time. Keep in mind that some activities can have more than one right answer, just like real problems can have more than one solution. The exemplars for these activities explain one way of doing things, but they also point out where you could do things differently. This helps you check your approach to an assignment, not just your answers

## Scenario

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tE-suB7IQ-KPrLgeyHPiHg_9c7ddb31af994ab7bc38a40ca887de6e_line-y.png?expiry=1712102400000&hmac=ojt_QJ7tIEAv_w-AI2geohz1bFuvziVceiCPWSphXZM)

Review the scenario below. Then complete the step-by-step instructions.

Wonder City is a mid-sized city where increasing growth and traffic are impacting quality of life. According to a recent market assessment, the region’s population is expected to double in the next five years. Job growth is also expected to increase by 48%. This growth will impact street networks, parking and mobility.

Wonder City has several city-wide objectives related to reducing traffic congestion and improving the city’s infrastructure. In order to support these city-wide objectives, the Wonder City Transportation Authority (WCTA) will be launching five new bus lines. This initiative has been nicknamed Project Move It.

You have been hired as the project manager for this initiative. As the project manager, you will set OKRs to help clarify the project goals and define what needs to be done in order to deliver a successful project.

Here is some additional information about the project:

-   The project needs to be completed within two years.
    
-   Community member buy-in and support for the locations of the new bus lines will be required.
    
-   The project must adhere to all government regulations.
    
-   Stops along the new bus lines must connect neighboring suburbs to downtown and public resource facilities.
    
-   Bus lines must service at least 50% of the most densely-populated areas of Wonder City.
    
-   The project is intended to help improve wait times and increase ridership.
    
-   The plan includes a marketing campaign to promote the new lines.

**Step 2: Draft your first objective**

A list of objectives for Project Move It have been provided for you below. Select one and add it next to “O1” on the first line of the OKR card. 

Potential objectives for Project Move It:

-   Actively and meaningfully engage the public to generate buy-in and project support.
    
-   Make it easy to get around the greater Wonder City area via public transportation.
    
-   Promote public transportation as a convenient alternative to driving.
    
-   Provide a reliable and consistent public transportation service. 
    

Or, if you prefer, you may draft your own objective based on the scenario.

Remember that effective objectives are:

-   **Aspirational:** Is the objective challenging and inspiring?
    
-   **Aligned with company goals:** Does the objective support company and/or departmental OKRs?
    
-   **Action-oriented:** Does the objective motivate the team to take initiative?
    
-   **Concrete:** Can the project team easily grasp the objective?
    
-   **Significant:** Will achieving the objective make a meaningful impact or change from where you are currently?
    

For example, if the objective of an educational technology company was to provide products that consistently meet new educational standards, a project objective might be: *“Successfully launch version 2.0 of our early learning app in time for the national curriculum conference.”*

**Step 3: Add key results**

Next, write at least three key results for your objective next to “KR1,” “KR2,” and “KR3.” (You may add up to five key results for each objective, but only three are required for this activity.)

Each key result should address the following questions:

-   Does the key result help define success for your team?
    
-   Can it be measured to prove that you’ve achieved your objective?
    
-   Is it specific and time-bound?
    
-   Is it ambitious yet realistic?
    

Your key results should build on the scenario and additional project information, but it’s up to you to determine your success criteria. As an example, let’s return to the objective, *“Successfully launch version 2.0 of our early learning app.”* If you knew that a successful launch meant getting new users to download the app, you could create any of the following key results for the objective: 

-   15,000 new downloads within first quarter post launch
    
-   75,000 new downloads within first year post launch
    
-   25% of monthly downloads from new customers
    

Remember: OKRs are never set in stone--they can and should be revised as you make progress, so it’s okay if you need to adjust your key results later on.

**Step 4: Write 1-3 more OKRs**

Repeat steps 2 and 3 for a second, third and fourth objective to fill up the template.

### Pro Tip: Save the template

Finally, be sure to save a blank copy of the OKR template you used to complete this activity. You can use it for further practice or in your own personal or professional projects. These templates will be useful as you put together a portfolio of project management artifacts. You can use them to work through your thought processes as you demonstrate your experience to potential employers.

## What to Include in Your Response

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/CL-890d_Rai_vPdHf8Wo8w_840c9f0ae50d420ebd45a7ff50d31e9c_shortline-y.png?expiry=1712102400000&hmac=TCarJ4LOIzX_4pF2pV8ADZLGL9Wp-qrUC1gM4xcqqTw)

Be sure to address the following criteria in your completed OKR card:

-   The objective defines what needs to be achieved and describes a desired outcome
    
-   The key results are ambitious, specific, measurable, and define success for the objective
