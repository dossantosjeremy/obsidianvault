# What is a product manager
- As a product manager, you do not report to anybody and no one reports to you
- Product managers need to collaborate with a lot of different people. 
- Product managers are enablers
- They are the ones responsible for the product. 
- They are presenters, researchers... but the rest of the team takes care of their specialty best - designers design and developers develop. 
- Best to do it this way so that people can actually disagree with you. 

# What is a product
* Complicated question - it could be anything. 
* A product manager can be in charge of an entire platform (e.g. android, iOS) or specific features inside a bigger product. 

# Different kinds of PMs
* Internal: Part of a team usually called the internal tools. They build tools for people inside of the organisation, as opposed to the ones building tools for people outside. 
* Consumers: Tend to be more common. It is for more people, and in general these people are the average consumer. They tend to be more creative. They need to maximize usage or some other metric. No one is there to tell them what to do. 
	* They tend to speak a lot with customers to understand their needs
	* The bigger the user base the more powerful it is. 
* B2B / SaaS: Builds products at companies whose clients are other companies. Examples are Oracle or Salesforce. We need to make sure we are meeting the requirements of the companies we are selling to. If you are a B2B Product Manager you need to talk a lot to the sales team. In the business side, companies will tell you what they would be ready for. On the consumer side, it is difficult to predict. 
* Stakeholders: People you are building for or who can have input into what you are building. 


# Type of product manager you would be fit for
* Internal PM: Starting out in the role of product manager.
	* Project management 
	* Not a big risk of making it wrong - because you are not building for millions, you are building for the people who will use it internally
* Business to business: Good introduction to the role of PM - because you have less users than for consumers PM - you are not as flexible regarding what you can build. Priorities will be determined by the sales team and how much you can bring in. You will build on tighter deadline. 
* Consumer: People who do not mind uncertainty and a lot of pressure
	* Multiple users
	* Multiple platforms
	* Can cause a lot of money loss to the company
	* Extensive user testing - continually looking for feedback - iterate and test 
	* It is one in which you will learn a lot

# Product vs Project manager
* Project management is needed for a PM
* PMs have some metrics they need to reach and this means success to them. 
* Hired as a product manager you will have goals such as how to increase conversion by 10% this year. 
* On the front ent you are collecting requirements, ideas, defining future initiatives (so project management is important for a product manager
* Product manager: Accomplish a goal by any means)

## Project managers
They are only responsible for accomplishing a project, and not a goal. A project has a timeline and a budget as a constraint. 
Responsible for accomplishing a set of things, within a time and budget

# A day in the life of a product manager
* Keep up with the industry news: 
* Examples of sources to keep up: 
	* Techmeme.com
	* Hackernews
	* Launch ticker
	* producthunt
	* Company name into twitter and see what people are saying about the latest features. 
* Metrics dashboard, looking for unusual behavior in the release logs. 
* Trying to understand what is happening with the release and what can we do about it. 
* Customer feedback from emails, support and operations team
* Appstore reviews - what people are saying
* Beta forums
* 11am: Team standup meeting - looking at the sprint board and backlog
	* Next sprint
	* To do 
	* In progress
	* In testing
* What we are working on at the time. 
* What we recently completed
* If there is any blocker or we need help with anything. 
* Telling engineers and designers what are people lately saying about our product
* meet with designers about user feedback - use a whiteboard to sketch out some solutions - work on things we have already been brainstorming on
* Write specs, tickets, user stories for upcoming features. 
* Testing the latest mobile release for our feature
* test on android and ios - report bugs and issues on Jira - product management tool 
* 2PM and onwards - depending on the day
	* Monday: sprint grooming / sprint planning - or retrospective on the last sprint
	* Most days - attend meetings with other product managers or stakeholders to work on crossteam planning or get a feature clear. E.g. meeting with the sales team and telling them things are changing
	* Random throughout the week - meeting with data science team to discuss tests we ran, look at exploratory data from user behavior to help the designer come up with the right solution for the next iteration
	* Attend user tests for a given feature or present metric milestones to executives, investors or other product maangers
	* Work with the team to present recent accomplishments from the team
	* Meet a lot with new employees on product vision and direction 
	* There is no typical day for a product manager: but checking industry news and meeting with your own team, checking analytics may never change.
