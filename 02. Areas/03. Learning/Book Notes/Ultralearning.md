**Notes with BookFusion*
- use a spaced repetition software
- Top universities such as Harvard, MIT, and Yale are publishing their best courses for free online.
- Forums and discussion platforms mean that you can learn in groups without ever leaving your home.
- accelerating the career you have, transitioning to a new career, and cultivating a hidden  advantage in a competitive world
- Learning is often the major obstacle to transitioning to the career you want to have
- The core of the ultralearning strategy is intensity and a willingness to prioritize effectiveness
- The third way is to integrate ultralearning principles into the time and energy you already devote to learning. Think about    the last business book you read or the time you tried to pick up Spanish, pottery, or programming. What about that new software  you needed to learn for work? Those professional development hours you need to log to maintain your certification? Ultralearning doesn’t have to be an additional activity; it can inform the time you already spend learning. How can you align the learning and studies you already need to do with the principles for maximizing effectiveness?
- A week or two later, he decided on public speaking
- Metalearning: First Draw a Map. Start by learning how to learn the subject or skill you want to tackle. Discover how to do good research and how to draw  on your past competencies to learn new skills more easily.
- Focus: Sharpen Your Knife. Cultivate the ability to concentrate. Carve out chunks of time when you can focus on learning, and make it easy to just do  it.
- Directness: Go Straight Ahead. Learn by doing the thing you want to become good at. Don’t trade it off for other tasks, just because those are more convenient or comfortable.
* Drill: Attack Your Weakest Point. Be ruthless in improving your weakest points. Break down complex skills into small parts; then master those parts and build  them back together again   
* Retrieval: Test to Learn. Testing isn’t simply a way of assessing knowledge but a way of creating it. Test yourself before you feel confident, and push yourself to actively recall information rather than passively review it.         
* Feedback: Don’t Dodge the Punches. Feedback is harsh and uncomfortable. Know how to use it without letting your ego get in the way. Extract the signal from the noise, so you know what to pay attention to and what to ignore.
* Retention: Don’t Fill a Leaky Bucket. Understand what you forget and why. Learn to remember things not just for now but forever.
* Intuition: Dig Deep Before Building Up. Develop your intuition through play and exploration of concepts and skills. Understand how understanding works, and don’t recourse to cheap tricks of memorization to avoid deeply knowing things.
* Experimentation: Explore Outside Your Comfort Zone. All of these principles are only starting points. True mastery comes not just from following the path trodden by others but from exploring possibilities they haven’t yet imagined.

# Hand Notes
* Ultralearning makes it possible to learn a topic by being much more directed and focus

**Step 1**
* Draw a map
* Ask questions why, what and how
* Why: Why you want to learn
	* Extrinsic reasons: More often than not to improve career
	* intrinsic reasons: Can also be good
	* Reach out to experts to ask if the approach is good: Email, LinkedIn or Forums

**What:** Prepare 3 columns
* Facts: Things that need to be memorized
* Concepts: Things that need to be understood
* Procedures: Things that need to be practiced
* How: benchmark the most common way people learn stuff
	* Look at prestigious universities' syllabus
	* E.g. MIT, Harvard, Yale, Stanford
* If this a non academic: Look on internet how previous people applied the skill

**Syllabus**
* For things that have success criteria: We can modify the syllabus if needed
* For things for which we do not even understand the syllabus: Stick to the syllabus

**Emphasize and Excluse**
* Focus only on things that align with your goals
* Exclude things that do not align with your goals

About procrastination
* You usually know when you are procrastinating: Just get started. 
* Use approximately 10% of your time for meta-learning
* E.g. for a 6 months project - dedicate 10% of your time to metalearning

Diminishing returns
* Do meta learning in parallel with actual learning and compare the output
* If meta learning brings more value then continue it if not stop it

Focus problems: Starting, maintaining and optimizing. 

Starting: 
* Try to think that the feelings initially do not last long. 
* When you manage to do that, move on to another technique like pomodoro
* When you manage that, move on to another technique which is setting some time up for learning

Flow
* Do not care about flow: When trying to master a skill it is not pleasant - pleasure comes after

To prevent distraction
* Cognitively demanding tasks will be subject to distraction e.g. reading 
* If you superimpose an active task, it will be less subject to distraction e.g. repeating out loud

If attention derails from a task - aknowledge it and come back to the task

Adapt your context depending on the amount of focus you need. 
For instance - for some tasks, a calm state of mind is necessary e.g. mathematical proofs (being in the shower) - for that to happen you need to have worked on the project before. 
Environments will affect the degree of arousal - you need to have that taken into account

Focus duration
* If you can focus for only one minute then try 30 seconds and gradually increase.
* It will everytime be easier to manage the temptation
* Recognize when you manage to be focus and repeat the same state. 

Directedness
* Learning by being tied to a situation or context you want to use it in
* Learning activities: Connection with the context
* The most important resource is not to have access to recorded lectures - it is to access the problem set
* This is when you are doing the thing you want to get good at that the learning will take place

Summary:
* Learn by doing the exact thing you want to learn
* Sometimes the exact context is not achievable

Transfer
* If a learning situation is similar to the final one, then the transfer will be easier
* Transfer can happen at various levels that we do not initially imagine
* Learning directly is harder than indirectly but indirectly is better.
* Do project based learning
* Immerse yourself in communities
* Flight simulator method: As long as it is close to a real scenario (to the degree it does not affect decision making then it is enough)

Overkill approach
* Put yourself in an environment in which the demand of skills will be high
* Aim for an accomplishment that is high - e.g. photo exposition

Drill
* Take a practice and break it apart, identify the bottlenecks*
