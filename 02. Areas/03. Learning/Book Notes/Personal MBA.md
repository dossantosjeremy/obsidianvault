Read the book: the new business road test

### Maslow hierarchy of needs

People will consider self-actualization only when basic needs are attained.

Clayton Alderfer - people seek existence, relatedness, and growth.

### Basic behaviors

- drive to acquire
- Drive to feel
- Drive to bond
- Drive to learn

### Competition

If there is competition it means there is something for this idea, meaning that you do not have to prove there is a market as you have the proof customers are buying.

We can learn from our competition by becoming a customer for them and learning about everything they do.

### Mercenary rule

Do nor go building a business for the money alone.

### Crusader rule

If you do side projects on the side, as long as you can pay the bills. Do not invest time qnd effort before evaluating the idea.

### Products and Value

Products have a specific value because they can be duplicated. Are you sure you show respect send an email and ask for feedback on my best self Organize data into themes

### Product Types

Product:

- Create a tabgible product
- Inexpensively
- Acceptable level of quality
- Sell units
- Keep inventory

### Iteration cycle

Iteration:

- observe and say what you would like to improve
- Design and experiment with metrics
- Do the experiment and follow-up on the improvement / metrics
- Decide if it was an improvement or not
- At each cycle we should define what we want to change
 
### Iteration velocity

you need to determine quickly if there is demand for your product so you need to do iteratjons quickly

The worst response you can get: apathy

Give possibility to users to preorder, even if the product is not entirely ready- this is called shadow testing

If a lot of people preorder that means there is a market for that

### Market Analysis

- Know the alternatives
- Economic values
- People will always settle for the next best alternative

### Testing and Evaluation

Relative Importance Test:

- Which is most important
- which is least important

Relative importance: determining which attribute we should focus on

Identify critical assumptions!!

### Shadow testing

Important to test your offer before making it real You can offer something that does not exist yet Example of fitbit

### Minimum viable product

Create a minimum viable product to test your assumptions

Use incremental augmentation to test the improvements, to keep what works and delete what does not.

### Field testing

- Test on the field
- Use what you make, every day

### Marketing and Sales

Marketing is about being noticed Sales is about closing the deal

Key Concepts:

- Limited attention: People have limited attention so we must market accordingly

- Show, don't tell
- Screen customers- screen you customers out if they take you energy, time and money​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

# Point of entry

- Point of entry is when people enter the market in search for a product
- Addressability: the fact of being able to reach an audience.

## Addressability

- how easy it is to address someone to sell them something.
- Some problems have lower addressability than others.
- Think about some other ways in these cases, for instance with gatekeepers like doctors for patients.

## Desire

- effective marketing is about.  making people realise the product will help them achieve what they need.

## Visualisation

- encouraging users to experience a product with as many senses as possible, e.g driving a car.

# Framing

- use framing to communicate information persuasively, without leaving out information

# Free

- give away free value, that will attract paying customers

# Permission

- ask people you gave free value to, permission to contact them again.

# Hook

- use messages to hook the audience
- Example: 10,000 songs in your pocket

## Call to action
- ensure the message has a clear call to action
- Follow-up with asking permission for instance

## Narrative
- Customers want to live an adventure
- Like in the Hero Journey
- The hero journey: the hero is living his every day life until there is a call to adventure, in which he will learn and rise, before coming back to his everyday life, changed and respected from every body 
- Use testimonials and feedbacks

## Controversy
* Controversy can be a good thing as it is the first step towards a discussion. 
* For example, for the Personal MBA book, other people disagree that this book is better than an MBA. 
* Use controversy in a way that encourages discussion and helps make progress and defend a cause, not only using controversy for the sake of controversy

## Branding
There is no such thing as building a brand or improving a brand. In the end, it's about a reputation a company has, which takes time to build. 

# Sales

## Transaction
* Going from project to business is by making the first transaction. 
* It is best to do some market analysis first, to make sure you are building something people want. 
* Transaction is about to people exchanging something the other wants. 
* This is how businesses grow. 
* You have to create minimum viable business offer

## Trust
- No transaction can happen without trust between parties
- You have to work at making yourself more trustworthy. 

## Common ground
- it is important to know the needs of probable purchasers
- Look for a common ground
- The more interests are aligned with the ones of my prospects the more  they will trust me. 
- Negotiation: it is about exploring common grounds 
- The more you are open to options, the more you are likely to find a common ground 

## Pricing Uncertainty Principle
- There is a price for everything in life
- Any price can be set at any level at any time. 
- You can price amything you want at any price you want. 
- You need to be able to offer your customer a reason why this price is worth paying. 

## 4 Methods to Price Something

- Replacement cost: how much would it cost to replace. Add everything and add a margin for your time and effort. 
- Market comparison: how much for something similar in the market? 
- discounted cash flow: how much is it worth if it can bring value over time
- Works for things that are generating value over time
- Very common if businesses are sold or acquired to price them
- Value comparison: usually the most common way to price.
- The most effective: pricing depending on who you sell to.


## Price transition shock 
- discounts attract customers if the product is a commodity. 
- Raising price can increase demand by attracting a certain type of customer.
- When changing the price, think about 2 things: the profit and the type pf customer you will win. 

## Value-Based Selling
- This is how you support a given price. 
- Understanding and Reinforcing the Reason Why a Transaction is Valuable to the customer. 
- Sales Book: SPIN Selling
- 4 phases if successful selling
	- understanding the situation
	- Defining the problem
	- Clarifying short and long term implications of the problem
	- Quantifying the need payoff: financial and emotional benefit the customer would experience. 

## Education Based Selling
- invest time in educating customers about the product and its quality 
- Make sure you have a product of higher quality  

## Next Best Alternative Negotiation
- the more power you will have if you are able to walk away from the deal
- You will have more opportunities to say no if the alternatives are better
- you can bundle or unbundle various options

## Exclusivity
- being the unique source of what customers want
- Easier for products and services


## 3 universal currencies
- time, resources, flexibility
- you can trade some of these currencies for others. 

## three dimensions of negotiation 
- setup, structure and discussion 
- 1st: setting the stage for a favorable outcome
	- > Who is involved in the negotiation, and are they open to dealing with you?
	- ﻿﻿Who are you negotiating with, and do they know who you are and how you can help them?
	- ﻿﻿What are you proposing, and how does it benefit the other party?
	- ﻿﻿What's the setting will you present your offer in person, by phone, or by some other means?
	- ﻿﻿What are all of the environmental factors around the deal-do recent events make this deal more or less important to the other party?
- setup: what is everything you need to know about the other party to be able to negotiate 
- Make sure you are negotiating with the right person - the person who has the power to give you what you want. 
- Do your homework before presenting an offer.
- Structure: draft a proposal that the other party is likely to accept. 
- - ﻿﻿What will you propose, and how are you Framing your proposal to the other party?
- ﻿﻿What are the primary benefits of your proposal to the other party?
- ﻿﻿What is the other party's Next Best Alternative, and how is your proposal better?
- ﻿﻿How will you overcome the other party's objections and Barriers to Purchase?
- ﻿﻿Are there Trade-offs or concessions you're willing to make to reach an agreement?
- Discussion: presenting the offer to the other party. 

## Buffers
Intermediary between you and a negotiation


## Persuasion Resistance
- Try not to chase or appear desperate because this makes clients go away. 
- It is best to introduce ourselves as an assistant buyer.

## Reciprocation
- Reciprocation is a tendency we have to pay back for the gifts we receive. 
- Example in a car dealership: accepting the cookies can leas to buying the car.

## Damaging Admission
- Be upfront with your prospects about the drawbacks and trade-offs

## Option Fatigue
- Make a few recommendations to your prospects instead of showing everything that is available. 

## Barriers to purchase
- selling is about eliminating barriers to purchase: risks, unknowns and concerns.
- Reasons why someone may not buy
	- Will not work: social proof / referral
	- Will not work for me: social proof / referral
	- Too difficult
	- I can wait
	- Costs to much: address it via framing and value-based selling. 

## Offer a strong risk reversal 
- risk reversal helps decrease the barrier to purchase
- E.g with dogs and with the bed (try before you buy)

## Reactivation
The fact of contacting customers again to see if they would repurchase from you. 
Netflix does it by sending an email.

## Value Delivery
- Value stream: set of all the steps and all processes from the start of the value creation process all the way through the delivery of the end result to the customer. 

## Distribution channel
- Direct to end-users or intermediary
- Services as an example if direct to consumer
- Can damage reputation if you get it wrong
- Intermediary: the store makes a resale: countrrparty risk: the reseller screws up and damages reputation

## Expectation Effect
- Quality = Performance - Expectations
- Customers expectations need to be high enough. However, after that it must surpass expectations
- Provide something that delights the customer as a bonus

## Predictability
- uniformity: delivering the same characteristics
- Consistency: demivering the same value over time



- Reliability: delivering without error or delay

Predictability improves reputation and value perception benefits.

## quality signals

Increase the offer value in a tangible way

Works well in demonstration 


When not here can lead to absence blindness or unmet expectations

## throughput

The rate at which the value stream delivers outpu
Production throughput: how much time it takes for the additional unit
Satisfaction throughput: how long it takes to satisfy a customer

## duplication
- Duplicate value
- Combine it with automation

## Multiplication 
- It is duplication for an entire process or system.

## Scale
- The ability to duplicate or multiply a product as the demand increases
- If not done it creates scarcity
- Also possible through automation
- Products are easier to duplicate and shared resources to multiply
- Services are often difficult to scale

## Accumulation
- Toyota - Kaizen
- Small iterations everytime to make it better

## Amplification
- Any change made to a system is amplified by the size of the system. 

> [!CAUTION] Important
> Use the contente in amplification, systemization, multiplication, for my company. 

## Competition
- Don’t focus on delivering the same thing as the competition. 
- Deliver better than the competition. 

## Force multiplier
- Focus on building the business, not operating it. 
- Use force multipliers, example a factory 

## Systemization
- Building a diagram of a system helps
- Combine that with automation
- It allows you to focus on the business

## Triage
- Triage the issues, use a set of factors
- For instance for customer support: lifetime value, importance of the customer…
- Customize the questions we have
- Define a hierarchy of use-cases
- Create a set of questions to detect what is important what is not 

## Profit Margin
- Revenue-Cost/Revenue
- Markup: Price-Cost/Price

## Value Capture
- Capture just enough value to make the business operating

## Sufficiency
- The goal is to be sufficient. 
- Being sufficient is being successful 

## Company Valuation

- Basically the amount of money that comes in and the amount that goes out
- Balance sheet
- Free cash flow: the money that comes in minus the money needed for operations. 

## Income statement 
- The cash flow alone is not enough
- We need to relate the expenses, money in, with the actual operations and records
- This is what accountants do 
- Revenue - cost of good sold - expenses - taxes = net profit

## Balance sheet
- Asset - Liabilities = owner equity
- Snapshot of what the company owns 
- Assets: liability + owner equity
- Net worth = assets - liability
- Balanced sheets are compared several times during the year. 
- Asset: cash, accounts receivables….
- Liabilities: debt, account payable…

## Financial Ratios
- Ratios: they allow to make comparison between businesses
- Profit margin is a kind of profit ratio
- Return on assets: the way a company makes some return on the money it has
- Financial ratios are a way to check the business is doing well
- Leverage ratios: how the company uses debt
- Debt to equity: dividing total liability to shareholder’s equity 
- Other ratios, interest coverage: how much of the profit goes to pay debt
- Liquidity ratios: how much of the business goes to pay bills
- Efficiency ratio, e.g how well a business is managing assets and liabilities

## Cost-benefit analysis
- Cost benefit analysis only valuable if we are acting on it right after.

## Increase revenue 
- increase frequency of purchase
- Increase price
- Increase number of customers 
- Increase number of things they purchase
## Pricing Power
* Ability to increase a price without a lot of repercussion when it comes to the customers. 

## Lifetime value
* The value of customers over time with you. 
* The more a customer


## Available Acquisition Cost
- The higher the LTV, the higher the AAC
- Profit margin: average customer’s lifetime value, then substract the value streams costs (variable costs to create and deliver value)
- Substract fixed costs
- Multiply lifetime value by profit margins
- Substract results from net income

## Overhead

- Overhead: minimum amount of business resources necessary to continue operations.
- The lower the overhead, the faster we reach a point of sufficiency
- Minimum required: salaries, rent, utilities
## Fixed vs Variable costs

- Fixed costs: incurred no matter the value that is created. 
- Variable: related to the value you create. 

## Incremental Degradation
- There is no upper limit in the value you can producr
- Control costs but not so much that you loose value

## cash flow cycle
- Receivables: promises of payments accepted from others. 
- Being more revenue, cut costs
- Increqse profit margins, make more sales
- Speed up collection
- Try to get paid immediately
- Use credit as a backup if you need to

# Segregation of duties
- Made to prevent wrongdoings in a company. 
- Dividing powers and verifications among multiple individuals 
- Adding control 
- E.g: authorization, custody, record keeping, reconciliation
## - Limited responsibility
- A way to limit wrongdoings

## Opportunity costs
- The opportunity cost is, when taking a decision, the opportunity of the next best alternative we did not choose.
- We tend to not pay attention to what we do not see. 
- Think about the best alternative possible
- Try to consider all opportunities when making a decision. 

## Time value of money
- Generally speaking, the money now is worth more than the money later.

It helps you gain more but also loose more

## rounds of investment

Unless funding is essential, keep your autonomy

## bootstrap
- bootstrapping is the fact of growing a company without funding

## ROI

- return on investment
- All roi is an educated guess
- Useful skill to have
- The real value is really calculated retrospectively
- nothing really is worth paying a lot


## Sunk cost

- Continuing to pour time, energy and resources into things that will not bring anything

## internal controls
- standard operating procedure to collect data, keep business running smoothly

# Human mind

## Caveman Syndrome
