> 
> The purpose of this chapter is to reinforce two things. First, don\'t
> pick a bad market. Normal markets are fine. Great markets are great.
> Second, once you pick, commit to it until you figure it out.
> 
> If you try one hundred offers, I promise you will succeed. Most people
> never try anything. Others fail once, then give up. It takes
> resilience to succeed. Stop personalizing! It’s not about you! If your
> offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It means your offer
> sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying. So, try
> again. You’ll never become world class if you stop after a failed
> attempt.
> 
> If you find a crazy good market, ride it, and ride it hard. And if you
> pair a Grand Slam Offer with a crazy market, you’ll likely never need
> to work again (seriously). So have this skill set — the ability to
> accurately assess markets by taking into account pain, money,
> targeting, and growth — in your back pocket so that when lightning
> strikes, you can make sure it strikes twice.
> 
> Having established how to nail a market, let’s get back to pricing.
> The first step to making crazy money is charging premium prices.

> 
> Most business owners are not competing on price or value. In fact,
> they’re not actually competing on anything at all. Their pricing
> process typically goes something like this:
> 
> 1)Look at marketplace
> 
> 2)See what everyone else offers
> 
> 3)Take the average
> 
> 4)Go slightly below to remain “competitive”
> 
> 5)Provide what their competitors offers with a “little more”
> 
> 6)End up at a value proposition of “more for less”
> 
> And the big secret: those competitors they are copying are dead broke.

> ### Indicate a Time Interval 
> 
> You’re just letting people know the duration to expect here. This
> gives an example of how long your results will take to achieve.
> 
> Note: If you’re making any sort of quantifiable claim (like income
> gain or weight loss) most platforms will not approve this type of
> messaging with a stated duration to achievement because it implies a
> guarantee. It implies they are going to get this outcome in a period
> of time, which goes against many platform rules
