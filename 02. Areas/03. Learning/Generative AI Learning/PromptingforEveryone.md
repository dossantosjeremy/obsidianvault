  - Trained on internet, books...

  ## Text-to-Image Models

- **DALL·E**  
- **Midjourney**

  ## Transformer Architecture

- **"Attention is All You Need"** *(reference to the foundational paper on Transformers)*

  ## Zero-Shot Learning

- **Not learning** \= Learning on the fly. *(Zero-shot learning refers to models making predictions without prior examples of the specific task)*

  ## Prompt

- **Normal language output telling people what to do.** *(A prompt is a natural language instruction guiding the AI's response)*

  ## Designing a Prompt

- **LLM has only been trained to predict the next word.** *(LLMs do not "think" but rather generate text based on probabilities of word sequences)*  
  


  # Possibilities & Surprises

  ## Components of a Prompt

- **Instruction** *(Think questions and opinions)*  
- **Examples & data**

  ## Zero-Shot Learning

- **Not because you can, it means you should.**  
- **Question examples:**  
  - Start with a question & analyze.  
  - Add think data & examples.

  ## Prompt Engineering

1. **Prompt engineering requires domain knowledge.**  
     
   - Formulate good & bad structured data.  
   - Use prompt engineering, iterate & require exploration.

   

2. **Prompt engineering tools:**  
     
   - Modify outputs according to code, not a concept.  
   - **Human feedback loop** *(Allows refining responses based on human evaluation)*  
   - **Scale feedback loop**  
   - **Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF)**

   ## Model Response

- **Stochastic \= Random** *(LLM outputs are probabilistic rather than deterministic)*

  # **Delimiters**

- **Prompting using natural language requires rules and patterns.**  
    
- Use `<|end of prompt|>` to set boundaries for models that do not naturally detect mile changes.  
    
- **Parameter to tweak variability**  
    
  - **Temperature** *(Higher values increase randomness, lower values make outputs more deterministic)*  
  - **Top-p (Nucleus Sampling)** *(Limits sampling to the most probable tokens)*


- **COT (Chain of Thought)**  
    
  - Cleaning thought process.  
  - Force LLM to follow a reasoning path.

  ## Tips & Tricks
