# Definition

The Design Thinking framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving that includes activities like research, prototyping, and testing to help you understand who your user is, what their problems are, and what your design should include.

[[ðŸ”„ The product development lifecycle]]

The Design Thinking framework involves the following phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.

# An iterative process

Though it may sound like a linear process, the Design Thinking framework should be iterative, which means that youâ€™ll repeat certain phases as you refine your designs. For example, depending on the feedback you receive during testing, you might need to conduct additional research, brainstorm new ideas, or develop new prototypes.

# All the stages

## **Empathize**

## What to learn

- Users
- Problems
- Wants
- Needs
- Environment
- Context 

## Methodology

- Surveys
- Interviews
- Observations
- Competitive Analysis

## **Define**

* Determine which user problem is the most important to solve and why
* Clear goal for the design of the product
* The most important here: Having a clear problem Statement: Description of the user need that the design will address*
* Development of a value proposition: Summary of why the user would or should use the product or service we are designing

## **Ideate**

* Come up with as many design decisions as possible*
* Involve as many stakeholders as possible
* Use the brainstorming methodology
* Make choices related to the best potential solutions
* Return to user or competitive user research to narrow down ideas. 
* Create user flows to illustrate how users interact with the solution 

## **Prototype and Test**

* Produce an early model ofd a product that demonstrates its functionality and that can be used for testing. *
* Include testing throughout the design process, to iterate the designs based on user feedback instead of other reasons
* Test using a simple sketch, wireframe or sitemap
* Iterate to a more detailed design on paper and conduct another round of testing
* Iterate into a working, interactive model using a software
* Test more than one prototype at the same time to get feedback on multiple solutions
* Test the same prototype on multiple platforms
