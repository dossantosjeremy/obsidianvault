# 5 stages
The product development lifecycle has 5 stages:
- brainstorm
- define
- design
- test
- launch

## Brainstorm Stage
* The team starts thinking about of an idea for a product
* If the team does not know the user problem we want to solve, coming up with a list of user problems is a great start
* Think about the diversity of user problems at this stage. 
* Start by listing common problems that users might face. 
* We then choose one and we start coming up with ideas for solutions to that problem. 
* Good moment to check the competition and if there are similar products in the market. 


## Define Stage
- Define the specifications of the product
- Who is the product for
- What will the product do
- What features need to be included
- At this stage we should narrow down the focus of the idea. 


## Design
- Development of ideas for the product
- Drawing wireframes, which are outlines or sketches of the product
- Creating prototypes (early model of a product that convey its functionality)
- UX Writers: Button labels or other copy within the product wireframe and prototypes
- Including each product specifications from the define stage
- Making sure that every part of the design fits together. 
- Making sure that each action has the expected outcome. 
- Making sure each task a user needs to complete is clear and easy to understand, like navigating from a page to another


## Test 
- UX Designer works with the engineer to develop functional prototypes matching the original design
- Including details and features that fit the company's brand like font and color choices. 
- Writing the code and finalizing the overall structure of the product. 
- Test a functioning prototype of the prototype using tool like Figma or Adobe XD. 

#### Types of testing

- Internal testing within the company: to look for technical glitches and usability problems. This is often referred to as alpha testing.
- Review with stakeholders: to make sure the product is aligned with the companyâ€™s vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility, and follows government regulations for privacy, for example.
- External tests with potential users: This is the time to figure out whether the product provides a good user experience, meaning itâ€™s usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. This is often referred to as beta testing.

## Not a linear process

The product development life cycle isnâ€™t a completely linear process. Your team might cycle between designing and testing a few times before you're ready to launch the product!

## Launch phase
- Listing the app on a store
- Making a website go live
- Putting a physical product on store shelves
- Cycling back to design and testing stages to start working on the next version of a digital product. 

## Retro 
- Celebrate the work and start promoting the product
- Support team: Helping users learn how the product works
- Asking what worked and what could be improved? Were goals achieved? Were timelines met?
