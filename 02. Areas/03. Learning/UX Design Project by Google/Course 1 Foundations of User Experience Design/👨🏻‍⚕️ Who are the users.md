# Importance of the user

As a UX designer, your goal is to keep the user at the center of every decision you make, and to do that, you need to get to know your user.

# Getting to know the user

Most of the initial UX research that you conduct at the beginning of the project will be focused on getting to know the characteristics of your users, their goals, and their pain points. Understanding the user empowers you to design experiences that are helpful or easy to use.
