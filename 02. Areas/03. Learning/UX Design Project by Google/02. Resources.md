# Additional Resources for Accessibility

# Optional - Additional resources on designing for accessibility

You’re starting to understand the importance of accessibility–designing products, devices, services or environments for people with disabilities. Accessible designs allow users of diverse abilities to navigate, understand, and use your product.

One way to better empathize with your users who identify as having a disability is to experiment with assistive technologies–which includes any product, equipment, or system that enhances learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities.

When you’re designing digital experiences like websites and apps, it’s important to become familiar with the types of assistive technologies (ATs) that people might use to access it. Nearly all devices–especially computers, tablets, and smartphones–on the market today include some type of accessibility support. As a UX designer, it’ll be important to become personally familiar with many types of the ATs covered in the video [Assistive technology](https://www.coursera.org/learn/foundations-user-experience-design/item/pKWv0), so that you can provide easy-to-use and enjoyable user experiences for those users who depend on them to experience your product.

Different device types and operating systems have different accessibility features available, and those features are updated all the time! The best way to learn about what’s available on the device you’re using right now is to check the Help. Here are a few links to get you started:

- [Google Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL590L5WQmH8dvW6kLjd5jRDN0IiCJHLZZ) is a YouTube playlist that includes general information about various assistive technologies and how-to videos for using accessibility features in Chrome and on Chromebooks. If you’re using a Chromebook, there’s some additional guidance in the [Chromebook Help](https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/177893?hl=en&ref_topic=9016892). If you’re an Android user, you can learn how to use accessibility features in the [Android Accessibility Help](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android#topic=6007234).
- Microsoft’s guide for [accessibility features on Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows) includes descriptions of all available features, along with links to how-to content for using accessibility features on a Windows device.
- For Apple products, there’s [Get started with accessibility features on Mac](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/get-started-with-accessibility-features-mh35884/mac) and the [Accessibility Support page for iPhone](https://support.apple.com/accessibility).

## **Learn more about accessibility from Google**

If you’re ready to learn more about accessibility, check out this three-part series from Google UX researchers about building globally accessible products.

1. [Designing for Global Accessibility, Part I: Awareness is everything](https://design.google/library/designing-global-accessibility-part-1/) outlines how you can increase your awareness of accessibility issues and check your assumptions about users.
2. [Designing for Global Accessibility, Part II: Context matters](https://design.google/library/designing-global-accessibility-part-2/) explores why it’s critical to consider logistics during the design process, in order to expand your app’s usability and usefulness.
3. [Designing for Global Accessibility, Part III: Be inclusive by default](https://design.google/library/designing-global-accessibility-part-iii/) discusses how UX designers can make tactical decisions to create inclusive apps.

You can also start to familiarize yourself with design principles that keep accessibility front-and-center by reviewing the [Accessibility Guide for Google Material](https://material.io/design/usability/accessibility.html). Don’t worry if the topics outlined in this guide are advanced or unfamiliar. We’ll cover some key considerations for accessible designs in more detail as you progress through this certificate program. For now, simply focus on laying a foundation for designing with accessibility in mind. As you progress through the certificate program, you’ll complete activities that will continue building your knowledge and experience with designing for accessibility.
