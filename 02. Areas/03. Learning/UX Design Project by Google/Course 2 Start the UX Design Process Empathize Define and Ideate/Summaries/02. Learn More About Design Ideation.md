# Design Ideation Process

## Prepare for Ideation

1. Empathize with the user
	1. Create empathy maps
	2. Create personas
	3. Create user stories
	4. Create user journey maps
2. Define the problem
	1. The problem needs to be well-defined
	2. Knowing what problem you need to solve will keep the users' needs top of mind. 
3. Establish a creative environment
	   Choose an ideation space that is different from the workspace
1. Assemble a diverse team: Inclusive team of people with different races, genders, abilities and backgrounds
2. Think outside the box. Don't limit yourself to traditional ideas and solutions. Think big and get creative while ideating. There is no right or wrong way to practice design ideation. 

# Disclaimer
 * The first solutions we generate are often the least creative because they are the most obvious. 
 * When generating we should use the creative powers to their full potential.
