**07. Summary of the competitive audit how-to**

  

  

1. Steps to conduct a competitive audit

  

**Step 1. Outline the audit goals** 

As a UX designer, you know that the ideation process is most effective after you’ve completed an audit on your new client, Burger Garden, and their competitors. But before you move into the details of the audit, you have to define your goals. Since this project is for a website redesign, the goal of the competitive audit is to compare the user experience of each competitor’s website.

  

Using consistent language for rating competitor products can also create more uniform feedback and help you “grade” competitors. You can grade competitors on a scale of:

**Needs work:** The app is not usable, and users aren’t getting what they need from this aspect of the app.

**Okay:** This aspect has some issues, but with some work, it could meet user needs.

**Good:** This aspect works well, but doesn’t always provide users with the necessary information easily.

**Outstanding:** This aspect feels consistent, and it meets or exceeds the user’s needs. 

  

**Step 2. List competitors** 

Start to build the competitor audit using the template. First, ask the company or team who they consider to be their direct and indirect competitors. As a reminder, **direct competitors** have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience. **Indirect competitors** either have a similar set of offerings but focus on a different audience, or they have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience. Getting this information early can provide good insight into where the company really fits into their industry.

  

**Step 3. Determine the specific competitor aspects you want to compare**

Defining a list of aspects you want to compare makes it easier to compile your results for analysis later on in the process. For this example, imagine that you check out each of the competitors’ websites and rate them based on the following categories:  

- **First impressions:** Check out the website on both desktop and mobile devices, and make note of your first impressions. Is the website responsive, meaning that it resizes across devices? Does the design complement the product? How do you feel about the website?
- **Interaction:** Explore the user flow and navigation of the website. What features are available for users? Is the website accessible to all users, including those using screen readers? How inclusive is their website to non-English speakers? Will the user get confused as they click through the website pages, or is the navigation clear? 
- **Visual design:** Review competitor branding and their overall consistency. Does the website appear and feel the same throughout all sections and pages? Does the branding match the intended audience? Is the imagery and color palette memorable? 
- **Content:** Examine the written content included on the website. Does the tone of the content match the company’s branding? Will users be able to find the details they’re interested in? 

These are the aspects to list across the top row of the competitor audit. In the example spreadsheet, these aspects are listed in rows 3 and 4. This means you would fill in information about these aspects for each of the companies you’re evaluating.

  

**Interaction**

The next part of the competitive audit focuses on the user’s ability to quickly and efficiently find what they’re searching for on the website. 

  

**Visual design**

A website with clear and consistent visual design is a great way to draw users into a product and company.

  

**Content**

The tone of the content is another way to communicate a company’s brand and engage users.

  

**Step 5. Summarize your findings in a report**

After conducting research, gathering data, and analyzing your findings, summarize your work in a report. What you include in your report and how you present your findings will vary depending on the audit goals you outlined at the beginning of the process. For example, if your audit mainly focuses on comparing competitors’ audiences, you might want to include a few informational graphics with numbers and figures. Or, if your audit mainly focuses on visual design, you might want to include screenshots of your competitors’ websites with different areas highlighted. 

  

1. **Practise activity**

  

**An effective competitive audit should:** 

- Identify your key competitors
- Review the products that your competitors offer
- Understand how your competitors position themselves in the market
- Examine what your competition does well and what they could do better
- Consider how your competitors describe themselves

**An effective competitive audit can help:**

- Inform your design process
- Solve usability and accessibility problems
- Reveal gaps in the market 
- Provide reliable evidence about whether designs work or not 
- Save time, money, and energy 

  

**Step 3: Outline your competitive audit goals** 

Before you move into the details of your competitive audit, make sure to define your audit goals. In the CoffeeHouse example, since the overall project is for the design of the CoffeeHouse app, your goal could be to **compare the in-app purchasing experience of each competitor**. Once you’ve chosen your goal or goals, write them in the cell in row 1 where it says “Competitive audit goal”. 

Using consistent language for rating competitor products can create more uniform feedback and help you “grade” competitors. You can grade competitors on a scale of:

**Needs work:** The app is not usable, and users aren’t getting what they need from this aspect of the app.

**Okay:** This aspect has some issues, but with some work, it could meet user needs.

**Good:** This aspect works well, but doesn’t always provide users with the necessary information easily.

**Outstanding:** This aspect feels consistent, and it meets or exceeds the user’s needs. 

  

**Step 4: Add your competitors to the template**

You should include three to five competitors in your list. You can identify competitors by searching for products like yours online. Put your competitors’ names in the **Enter competitor** cells in column A, located on the left side of your table. Some competitors should be direct and others should be indirect. Record in the template if that competitor is direct or indirect. Do this in the cell to the right of the competitor’s name.

As a reminder: 

- **Direct competitors** have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience. Essentially, you’re both trying to solve the same problem. 
- **Indirect competitors** either have a similar set of offerings, but focus on a different audience or have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience.

Including both direct and indirect competitors in your audit gives a better picture of the full competitive landscape.

  

**Step 6: Add research findings to the template**

Review each competitor’s website and app and insert your findings in the spreadsheet. Remember to include details like what works well, what could be improved, and whether your competitor meets the needs of their target audience. As you explore, start by taking note of your initial feelings about your overall experience. 

  

It’s also helpful to take screenshots and link to them in the spreadsheet. These will be important to have for presenting your findings later on. You can follow the links below for help with adding images to the spreadsheet template.

  

**Step 7: Analyze your findings**

Try to notice trends and themes. 

**Ask yourself:** What are the similarities and differences between you and your competitors? Is there a feature that your competitors all approach in the same way? Is there a competitor that is doing something completely unique compared to the others? It's a good idea to make note of the findings. You will use this information in your report.

To create your competitive audit report, you’ll present the insights from your audit in narrative form. Consider the themes and trends you uncovered during your audit while writing your report. There are nine sections in the report template, to be filled out as follows:

1. **Competitive audit goal(s).** Enter the goal(s) from the top of your audit spreadsheet.
2. **Who are your key competitors?** Consult your research and the **General information** section of your audit and describe each competitor in 1-2 sentences. Be sure to note whether they are direct or indirect competitors.
3. **What are the type and quality of competitors’ products?** Describe what each competitor offers, making note of what they do well and what they could do better. Your answers should be complete, but relatively brief—no more than a short paragraph (2-5 sentences) for each competitor. 
4. **How do competitors position themselves in the market?** Describe each competitor’s target audience in a few sentences. Be specific about characteristics of their ideal customers (e.g., age, location, income, spending habits, etc.).
5. **How do competitors talk about themselves?** Consider each company’s value proposition. Summarize what they claim is unique about their offerings in 2-3 sentences.
6. **Competitors’ strengths.** List 2-4 things each competitor does particularly well.
7. **Competitors’ weaknesses.** List 2-4 things each competitor could do better.
8. **Gaps.** Consider what your competitors fail to do. Identify 2-3 gaps in the market that they do not fill (e.g., design or product features, customization, etc.). 
9. **Opportunities.** Consider ways you might address the market gaps you identified. List 2-3 opportunities for your product to stand out from its competitors.

**Step 9: Reflect on the completion of this activity**

**Does your competitive audit spreadsheet and final report:**

- Identify three to six key competitors, complete with “direct” and “indirect” designations?
- Include clear competitive audit goals at the top?
- Review the products that the competitors have to offer? 
- Include three to six features for comparing the businesses that are based on the competitive audit goal? 
- Include an analysis of trends among competitors? 
- Comment on how your competitors position themselves in the market? 
- Examine what the competition does well and what they could do better?
- Consider how the competitors describe themselves?
- Describe the competitors’ strengths and weaknesses? 
- Highlight gaps in the competitors’ products? 
- Identify opportunities where your product can stand out and make itself unique? 

  

The example scenario above is from a competitive audit that was completed for CoffeeHouse. The exemplar includes the following actions: 

  

**1. Outlining the goals for the competitive audit**

In order to learn how to make the coffee app, the overall goal was to: Compare the purchasing experience of each competitor’s app as a new user and a returning user. 

**2. Creating a list of competitors**

  

First, an online search for CoffeeHouse's product, coffee, was completed. This helped determine who the competitors were. Then, the competitors were added to the spreadsheet which was downloaded at the beginning of the audit.

  

For our example, two competitors that might have been found during through online research were identified:

- **JavaMate**, a coffee chain that features a variety of fresh-brewed coffee and specialty drinks. JavaMate is a direct competitor of CoffeeHouse.
- **BeanTown**, a subscription mail-order service that sends a monthly supply of roasted coffee beans to subscribers’ homes. BeanTown is an indirect competitor to CoffeeHouse.

**3. Research**

  

The research started with downloading and using each competitor’s app. Then, the details about the app were entered in the competitive audit comparison spreadsheet.

**4. Analyzing and summarizing the findings**

  

The information in the spreadsheet was analyzed for trends and themes. To summarize the findings, the competitive audit report template in the instructions was used. In the report, the following points are addressed: 

- CoffeeHouse's key competitors
- The products that CoffeeHouse's competitors offered
- How CoffeeHouse's competitors position themselves in the market
- What CoffeeHouse's competition does well and what they could do better
- How CoffeeHouse's competitors describe themselves 
- Strengths and weaknesses of CoffeeHouse's competitors
- Gaps in CoffeeHouse's competitor's products
- Opportunities for CoffeeHouse to stand out

Keep in mind this is a very simple report, with only two competitor businesses. Your report may be longer and more detailed than this example.

Now, compare the example spreadsheet and report to the competitive audit comparison and report you created. Assess what you’ve done using each of the criteria used here to evaluate the exemplar. Did you: 

- Identify three to six key competitors, complete with “direct” and “indirect” designations?
- Have a clear competitive audit goal at the top?
- Review the products that the competitors have to offer? 
- Have three to six features for comparing the businesses, based on the competitive audit goal? 
- Have an analysis of trends among competitors? 
- Comment on how your competitors position themselves in the market? 
- Examine what the competition does well and what they could do better?
- Consider how the competitors describe themselves?
- Describe the competitors’ strengths and weaknesses? 
- Highlight gaps in the competitors’ products? 
- Identify opportunities where your product can stand out and make itself unique? 

If so, congratulations! If not, consider going back to make sure you fulfill all the criteria.
