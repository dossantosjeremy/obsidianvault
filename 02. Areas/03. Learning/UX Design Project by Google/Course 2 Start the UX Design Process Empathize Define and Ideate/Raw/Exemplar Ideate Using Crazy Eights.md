**3. Describe at least three of the ideas you generated with your Crazy Eights activity.**

- Bean Bag Bonus program to build loyalty of patrons who buy 1-pound bags of whole bean or ground coffee.
- Reserve a spot option to encourage more patrons to stay and work or socialize. A small subset of tables are opened up for 2-hour reservation slots each day.
