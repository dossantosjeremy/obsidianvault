**Intro to course 3 - Build Wireframes and low fidelity prototypes**

Welcome to Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes, the third of seven courses in the Google UX Design Certificate. In this course, you’ll continue to work on the project prompt you selected during the previous course of the program, focused on designing a mobile app. You’ll start by sketching storyboards and getting familiar with the basics of drawing. Then, you'll create wireframes on paper and in the design tool Figma. You’ll also create paper prototypes and digital low-fidelity prototypes in Figma. These hands-on activities simulate real tasks that you might do on-the-job as an entry-level UX designer. 

Content and projects in each course of this certificate program build on information practiced in earlier courses. To be successful in this course, you should complete the previous two courses of this certificate program, if you haven't already done so.

Each course of the Google UX Design Certificate is broken into weeks. You can complete courses at your own pace, but the weekly breakdowns are designed to help you finish the program in about six months total.

So, what practical design skills can you expect to develop during this course? Here’s a quick overview of the content to come:

**Week 1: Storyboarding and wireframing.** You'll start by learning how to use research findings to inform ideation during the design process. Next, you'll create two types of storyboards: big picture and close-up. Then, you'll draw your first wireframes, and you'll explore the benefits of wireframing. Keep in mind that at this point in the design process, you should have lots of ideas for designs that address real user needs. You want to refine those ideas, and wireframing can help you do that.

**Week 2: Creating paper and digital wireframes.** This is an action-packed part of the course where you'll draw wireframes for a mobile app. First, you'll draw lots of wireframes on paper. Then, you'll transition to digital wireframes in the design tool Figma. You'll even learn directly from Figma about how to best use their tool. Finally, you'll apply Gestalt Principles, like similarity, proximity, and common region, to your wireframes.

**Week 3: Building low-fidelity prototypes.** You've gone through the first three stages of the design process: empathize, define, and ideate. Now, you'll enter the fourth stage of the design process: prototype. First, you'll create a paper prototype of your mobile app. Then, you'll transition to create a digital low-fidelity prototype in Figma. In addition, you'll explore ways to recognize potential bias in your designs and learn how to avoid deceptive patterns.

Portfolio project

As you make your way through this certificate program, you will create projects to include in your professional portfolio to show to potential employers. In this course, you’ll continue to develop the **designs for a mobile app**, based on the project prompt you selected in the previous course. For example, if you selected a prompt to design an app for your local burger restaurant in the previous course, you will continue through the design process with this same project. 

- In Course 2, you learned how to **empathize** with potential users and **define** users’ needs. 
- Now, in Course 3, you will come up with **ideas** for solutions that address the users’ needs. You’ll create wireframes and a low-fidelity **prototype** of your app. 
- Later, in Course 4, you will plan and conduct research to **test** your designs and get feedback from users. 
- Finally, in Course 5, you will create mockups and a high-fidelity **prototype** of your app and conduct a second round of user **testing**. 

Everything you build in the courses of this program will eventually be included in your online portfolio. Taking the courses in this certificate program in order will allow you to follow the steps of the design process and end up with all of the artifacts you’ll need to include in your portfolio. Good luck!
