**Summary: Wireframes for the app**

**Information architecture**

Mobile screen
- Focus on the essential content

**Guidelines to create a good wireframe**

- Wireframes are made up of elements. Elements are building blocks used for creating a design. 

- Most of the time, we use lines, shapes and text.

  

  

  

  

  

- Review the research and storyboards made.
- Review the user flows
- Create several wireframes for each screen of the app
- Build a list of elements that should go into the wireframe

- Use the crazy eight exercise
- Use the storyboards

- Create five versions for each screen of the app
- Set a 2 minute timer for each drawing
- Review each version and add a star besides the versions you like the most
- Choose the versions that help solve the problem statement the most
- Repeat steps 3 to 5 until you have built at least 5 pages
- Prioritise the screens that will be critical for the user flow
