# Information Architecture Concepts and Definitions
* The information should be clearly organized and sorted, so users can experience and interact with the app or website. 
* This process is information architecture.
* Information Architecture is a map of our product. 

# The 3 pieces of information architecture
1. **Organization**: The organization is how different pieces of information connect in a product.
2. **Hierarchy**: The hierarchy is often called the ‚Äútree structure‚Äù and is where a larger category is placed at the top and specific categories related to the overall category are placed underneath. Peer information is placed side by side (or on the same level as each other).
3. **Sequence**: The sequence enables users to move through an app via certain orders or steps.

# 8 Principles of Information Architecture 
* Created by the founders of eight shapes. 
* 1. **Object principle**: You should view your content as ‚Äúliving‚Äù and as something that changes and grows over time.
2. **Choice principle**: People think they want to have many choices, but they actually need fewer choices that are well-organized.
3. **Disclosure principle**: Information should not be unexpected or unnecessary.
4. **Exemplar principle**: Humans put things into categories and group different concepts together.
5. **Front door principle**: People will usually arrive at a homepage from another website.
6. **Multiple classification principle**: People have different ways of searching for information.
7. **Focused navigation principle**: There must be a strategy and logic behind the way navigation menus are designed.
8. **Growth principle**: The amount of content in a design will grow over time.

# Principles for a great sitemap
* A website or an app should be mapped in a hierarchical way.
* This connection. Is referred to as the parent/child connection. 
* Know the purpose of the app and how users can benefit from it

	* There wont be as many categories in a mobile sitemap.
	* Mobile screens are generally smaller
	* Consider ways to focus on the essential content
	* Eliminate or move around less important content
	* Consider the size and spacing of touchscreen targets
	* Consider ways to make sure the text will be large enough
