# What you need to build a storyboard

1. First, you need a problem statement to identify the character and scene for your storyboard.
2. Next, you need a goal statement. 
3. Add one-sentence descriptions that explain the context of the story
4. Add a sentence that sets the narrative for the design at the top of the template. 
	1. Short sentence
	2. Should help us understand the user and the problem the design solves for them
6. Finally, fill in the six panels of the template with visuals that demonstrate the user's experience with your app.
7. Each visual should
	1. Highlight a key moment in the user's journey
	2. Include context and motivations
	3. Experience of successfully using the service
8. Captions are useful for interactions difficult to sketch out. 

# Elements of a storyboard

* Character: States the user in the storyboard.
* Scene: Gives designers a way to imagine the userâ€™s environment.
* Plot: Describes the solution or benefit offered by the design.
* Narrative: Describes the problem the user is facing and how the design will solve this problem.

# Types of Storyboards

## Big picture storyboard
- Focus on the user
- Communicate the environment or context
- Communicate motivation for using the app
	- Example: pain point
	- Example: Market opportunity
- What the user needs
- The context
- Why the product will be useful to the user
- Used early in the design process when designers want stakeholders to support their idea

## Close-up storyboard
* The product on how it works
* Middle to end of the design process
* Describe how the user interacts with the design
* The visuals and captions for the close-up storyboard should focus on the product
* Think about the product details you want to bring attention to and why
* Show the flow of user actions and how each step will lead to the next
* Think about what happens on each screen
* Think about what does the user do to transition from one screen to another

# Step-by-step process

1. Start with a problem statement
2. Create the goal statement
	1. This is the plot (benefit or solution of your design)
3. Set up the storyboard
	1. Use the storyboard template
	2. At the top of the page, there is place to describe the scenario
	3. On the template there are spaces for images and descriptions of action
4. Add the storyboard scenario
	1. Think about the problem statement
	2. Then think about the solution from the goal statement
	3. Write a short clear sentence that describes the user and the problem the design solves for them. 
	4. Consider the end result that will solve the end user problem. 
5. Draw one idea per panel
	1. Push the story forward
	2. Indicate how the user might feel 
6. Big picture storybard vs Close Up
	1. Remember that big-picture storyboards should focus on the user experience. 
		1. It should show how people use the product and why the product is useful to them. 
		2. Important here to include a picture of an emotion by using for instance a sad or happy face, at different steps of the journey
	2. Close Up storyboard
		1. They focus on the product
			1. Think about which product details you want to draw attention to and why
			2. We want to demonstrate the user flow within the product and how each action within the product leads to the next screen.
		2. In the first panel, the user opens the phone and swipes through the apps
		3. Oftentimes close-ups will focus on how users begin their journey when they open an app. 
7. Expose pain points of the users at different steps of the journey
8. Include the user goal or conclusion in the final panel
