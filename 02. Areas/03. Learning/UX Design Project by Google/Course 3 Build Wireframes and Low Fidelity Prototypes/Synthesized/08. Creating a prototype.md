# Paper Prototype

## Advice
* Tapping any element that should be tapped
* Helps to make sure if elements are in the best location*

## Possible to use pre-printed templates

## Index cards
* Advantage: Remove a drawing we do not like without having to cross things out
* Useful for brainstorming sessions: We can add, reorder or remove

## Sticky notes
* Call out important parts of the prototypes
* Jot down a single idea on each

## Stencil
- Built in ruler and symbol

## Demo device

# Digital Prototype
* Go into each of the interactive elements and ask yourself what element needs to be connected to this one.
* Make sure every elements we have designed that is interactive has something it connects to. 
* If an element interactive has nothing to connect
	* Then this element either needs to be taken away from the design
	* Or another screen should be created


## Questions to ask ourselves
1. How are users going to interact with my product
2. What are common user flows through my product?
3. What buttons will users interact with?
4. What will users expect to happen after they click on a button a submit a form?
5. Did we connect all the wireframes required to complete the main user flow?
6. Did we provide a means to the user to go backwards and forward in the flow?
7. Are clues for navigation clearly indicated?
8. Did we return the users to a sample origin after they completed the activity

# Evaluation of a prototype
1. Have a complete user flow of at least 3 screens
2. Define the UI elements for each screen
3. Indicating the organization or hierarchy of any element depicted on the screen
4. Build elements
5. Think about the hierarchy of information
	1. Text size
	2. Text weigh
	3. Location
	4. Other elements
6. Most important elements should be discoverable in the design
7. Experiment with layout and spacing
