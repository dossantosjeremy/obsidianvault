# Why we create wireframes
* Establish the main structrue of the page
* Highlight the intended function of each element*



# Steps to create a wireframe
1. Review the research and the storyboards already made. 
2. Think about the main user flow that will be followed
3. Refer back to storyboard and user flow
4. Create multiple wireframes for the same screen of the app
5. Example: We come up with a lot of ideas
	1. For the structure of the page
	2. For the intended function of each element on the homepage
6. Write a lit of elements that need to be present in the wireframe
	1. Crazy eight
	2. Storyboards
7. Homepage, think about
	1. Elements the user will want to see
	2. Elements the user will want to use every time they open the app
8. Don't get stuck trying the perfect thing. You need to test it out
9. Create 5 different versions of how to structure the information on the page. 
10. Set a timer of 2 minutes for each variant. 
11. Review the wireframes and add a star next to the pieces you like
12. Combine elements into a refined wireframe
13. Repeat steps 3 to 5 until you have buit out refined wireframes for at least 5 pages

# Good criteria of a wireframe
* Clearly defines the elements intended for the page
* Includes multiple versions that arrange elements
* Provides with distinct examples to compare and test*
* The wireframe is made up of elements which are building blocks
	* Lines
	* Shapes
	* Text

# Wireframes Industry standard
* Text: Horizontal line
* Images, photos, illustrations and icons are represented by a square or rectangle and an X
* Calls to action: Rectangles or circles*

# Guidance for Digital Wireframes
* Place the paper wireframe side by side
* Follow the most commonly used devices and software to ensure it remains consistent throughout the process
* Use a grid to keep a consistent layout
* Define hierarchy
	* Size
	* Text weight
	* Location
* What is most important to the user should be discoverable
* Experiment with visuals and spacing to ensure a visually pleasing design
* Focus on structure at this step
* Should add more detail than the paper screen
* Think about hierarchy of information
* Start by building elements
* Build individual elements first
* Then assemble the elements
* Repeat for each screen of the app
* Arrange the wireframes in a logical order to make prototyping smoother

# Wireframes and information architecture
## In general
- Leave only a few choices to the users
- Include only expected information
- Allow for different ways to search information 
- Think that the menus will grow over time
- Login / sign up screen
- Help, Settings (profile (name, email address, user profile…), security, help, policies…), help (search for help, browse topics, contact us…)

## Mobile Screens
- Leave only a few choices to the users
- Include only expected information
- Allow for different ways to search information 
- Think that the menus will grow over time
- Login / sign up screen
- Help, Settings (profile (name, email address, user profile…), security, help, policies…), help (search for help, browse topics, contact us…)

# Checklist
* Be based on paper wireframes
* Adding details
* Thinking about the information hierarchy
* Let users what they can do on the screen*
