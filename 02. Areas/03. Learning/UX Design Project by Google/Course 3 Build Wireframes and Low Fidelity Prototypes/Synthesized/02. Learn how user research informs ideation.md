# Importance of user research

The design should be based on insights from actual user research, not assumptions. 

# Ideation

## Objective 
- The goal is to come up with as many ideas as possible for potential solutions to the user problems identified. 
- You should try multiple ideation techniques and be prepared to have multiple ideation sessions. 

## Tools previously used
- **Empathy maps** explore usersâ€™ four main motivations: what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. The insights gathered from empathy maps help you come up with ideas for solutions that address the userâ€™s real problems.Â 
- **Personas** place the users who youâ€™re designing for front-and-center. By creating detailed user profiles, you can clearly envision potential users that youâ€™d design for.
- **User stories** determine which user needs are the most critical to address with your designs. This direction will help focus your ideation.
- **User journeys** help you come up with ideas for designs that truly support the usersâ€™ needs and solve their problems.Â 
- A **problem statement** is a clear description of the userâ€™s need that should be addressed. The problem statement you created in the last course will guide the focus of your ideation.
