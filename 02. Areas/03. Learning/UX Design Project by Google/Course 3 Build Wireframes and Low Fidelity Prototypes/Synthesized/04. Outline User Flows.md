# Steps to prepare a user flow
1. Requires a full understanding of users and their needs
2. You can also try to predict users' needs before they know what they want or need (example: The cashier at McDonald's)
3. Consider the entire journey the users take in order to get what they need from the product
4. Reference the problem statement you developed to make sure the design addresses user needs
5. The user flow could change based on the needs of users and their circumstances
6. Decide which user task to map
	1. Choose a task that is important
	2. Use the goal statement to help identify a primary user task
7. Focus on mapping the quickest and easiest way to get from the entry point to task completion


# User Flow Definition
* A **user flow** is the path taken by a typical user on an app or a website, so they can complete a task from start to finish.

# Questions to ask before designing the user flow
- What actions will users take in the app?
- What decisions will users make?
- What screens will users experience after taking action or making a decision?

# How to draw a user flow
- Designing using shapes: Circles, rectangles, diamonds, lines with arrows
- Each shape: Interaction the user will have with the product being designed

# Elements of a user flow
* **Action:**
	* The actions users take when moving through a product design are represented as circles.
	* Circles show steps that must be taken to complete a task from start to finish. 
* **Screen:** 
	* The screens of a digital product that users will experience while completing tasks are represented as rectangles. 
* **Decision:**
	* Diamonds represent points in the user flow where users must ask a question and make a decision.
	* The decision users make will either move them forward through the flow or back to an earlier part of the flow. 
* **User flow direction**:
	* Lines with arrows tie everything together and display the flow of information.
	* Solid lines indicate forward direction through the user flow, and the dotted lines indicate backward direction or returning to a previous page.
