Summarized information

  
  

- A lack of synthesis can lead researchers down the path of conducting the same research over and over again. 
    
- Objective of our insights: Timelessness and durability. 
    
- In the long-run, a lack of synthesis can be a detriment to user research, and ultimately, the user experience, product, and business strategy.
    
- The need to fundamentally understand users and generate a set of initial user needs to inform product design and development
    
- The need to integrate user and customer insights into business strategy and shape the direction of the business
    
- The need to deeply understand a topic that is core to the user experience with a product — say for instance how individuals come to trust technology, how people pay attention for prolonged periods of time, or how teams make critical decisions
    
- The need to articulate and archive numerous user insights in one place that are timeless and durable — these insights are an be used over to inform the user experience or product direction, establishing within the research.

- Have you ever been asked “Hey, do we have any research about [fill in the blank]?” and not known where or how to search for the past research that answers this question?
    
-   
    
- “What do we know about [fill in the blank]?”
    
- “Do we have any research on…[fill in the blank]?”
    
- I bet those questions sound familiar. Having a user research repository of well organized projects and groups of key insights in an easily searched place helps you answer those questions almost effortlessly.
    
-   
    
- We can cross-pollinate by summarizing and collate existing research to have a broader picture of users outside a specific studies. 
    
- Insights from past studies can serve as a foundation for future studies and provide a high level overview of user behaviors and mental models.
    
- It can be a research project in itself also known as desk research or secondary research. 
    

  

- Imagine a workplace where every research request you receive takes into account what your organization already knows. Product teams have the answers to common UX questions at their fingertips, and finding insights has become second nature to everyone.
    
- Over time, these references build upon each other, making our research more durable and timeless.
    
-   
    
- When someone pulls up an insight through a search, they can see how much evidence supports it and trace that insight back to its source.
    
- If a user were to take an insight out of context, say to make an argument in favor of a new product feature, HITS makes it possible for everyone involved to look at the supporting evidence and come to a fuller understanding of what the context implies.
    
- When a product manager asks me whether a push notification in a given circumstance will be too distracting, for example, I can run a search, pull up the most relevant insights on focus and distraction, and send them the link, accomplishing what might have been several days’ work—or even a whole redundant study—in a few minutes. Better yet, PMs and designers can learn to do this themselves.

- Most of the time we discover insights that are not about the goal
    
- It is possible that these insights are even more important than the ones we were originally looking for at the start. 
    
- When some issues keep showing up in different studies (without even focusing on it), it’s possible it’s a bigger issue than it seemed beforehand.
    

- Always review what research has already been done to avoid covering the same ground. 
    
- Ambiguity around whether a product team has done sufficient research to feel confident about their decisions. 
    
- Leading to reviving old design concepts to see whether they are still viable. 
    
- Meta-analysis: allows to understand the back story and determine a way forward. 
    
- A meta-analysis provides an opportunity to gather and analyze all of the research that has been done on a particular topic. 
    
- By analyzing past research, a team can appreciate the full scope of what has already been done and understand key findings they can use as a frame for understanding the problem—what worked and didn’t work for users—as well as to determine what is missing, and identify potential goals for new research efforts.
    
- Meta-analysis can help you simplify research findings by providing a summary estimate of the overall effect of a variable or intervention on an outcome.
    

  

- Meta Analysis should be used to uncover hidden insights
    
- The ability to see the bigger picture and look beyond insights in isolation, gives researchers the ability to unlock exponential strategic value.
    
- While conducting individual studies and experiments is essential, the true potential of research lies in the broader, more encompassing realm of meta-analysis. 
    
- At its core, meta-analysis is the art (and science) of stepping back from individual studies to see the bigger picture. In simple terms it's the process of systematically collecting and analysing data from multiple studies to uncover patterns, trends, and opportunities that might otherwise be elusive when examining each study or insight in isolation.
    
- The pitfall of isolated insights‍
    

- Imagine standing in a vast forest, each tree representing a unique insight from your research endeavours. Alone, each tree is remarkable, providing valuable information and potentially sparking innovative ideas. However, focusing solely on these isolated trees can keep you confined to a limited perspective.
    
- When we conduct research in isolation, we risk missing the bigger picture. We become like a scholar studying one page of a book while ignoring the rest. While this approach can yield valuable knowledge, it often falls short of capturing the rich tapestry of insights that lie hidden within the broader research landscape.
    
- The meta-analysis advantage
    

- Meta-analysis is akin to stepping back to see the entire forest. It involves systematically collecting and analysing insights from multiple studies – enabling researchers to identify overarching patterns, trends, and opportunities that might otherwise remain untapped. 
    
- It's about finding those hidden gems that sit across studies, sometimes even discovered across different teams and departments, that strategically elevate people and organisations conducting research.
    
- One of the key benefits of meta-analysis is its ability to uncover insights that transcend the boundaries of individual studies. It's about connecting the dots between seemingly unrelated findings and creating a holistic understanding of a particular subject or problem. This holistic perspective is where the true value of meta-analysis lies.
    
- The exponential value of triangulation
    
- Think of meta-analysis as triangulation. Instead of relying solely on a single study, you gather evidence and insights from multiple viewpoints. This approach often helps to enhance the strength and reliability of your findings and recommendations. 
    
- But triangulation serves not only to further validate isolated insights and studies, crucially, it also helps to reveal previously concealed patterns, potentially leading to important discoveries in underlying human behaviour.
    
- At the end of the day, an insight in isolation can be extremely powerful, but when combined and triangulated with insights from different studies and perspectives, the value of your research can become exponential.
    
- In today's fast-paced world, where innovation and progress happen at breakneck speed, not conducting meta-analysis can often lead to stagnated research maturity, and ultimately, missed opportunities in your industry. 
    
- This shift is not just about being proactive; it's about driving innovation, progress, and growth. It's about being able to leverage existing knowledge to quickly identify underlying problems, behavioural patterns, and ultimately guide better decision-making.
    
- In our experience, a team that’s able to reach this level of research maturity will quickly become an indispensable strategic asset to any organisation.
    
- Imagine the strategic advantage of being able to swiftly shift focus from ‘acquisition’ to ‘retention’, or responding within minutes to leadership with a trove of relevant insights that support new company-wide initiatives and strategies – based on the meta-analysis of your existing studies. 
    
- This proactive approach not only enhances your reputation as a researcher, but also streamlines your research efforts. You'll spend less time searching for existing insights (that you know exist… somewhere!), and minimise the risk of repeating research – enabling you to spend more of your time delving into new and innovative areas of exploration.
    
- Closing thoughts
    
- In an era where research and innovation are moving at an unprecedented pace, staying confined to isolated insights is a recipe to remain stagnant. It's time to break free, to become a strategic partner, and to harness the exponential value of meta-analysis.
    
- Your research study is likely valuable, but that value has its limits when kept in isolation.
    
- Within the fast evolving world of research, meta-analysis is not an option; it's a necessity. It's the key to unlocking the hidden potential within your existing insights. It's about transcending the boundaries of isolated studies and discovering the interconnected patterns that hold the power to innovate in your field.
    
- This approach not only helps uncover gaps and opportunities but also fosters collaboration and interdisciplinary thinking within your research organisation. It's a tangible step towards becoming more aware of the true value of your existing insights, and realising the full strategic value that you and your team can bring to the organisation.
    

  
  
  

Raw information

  

What cross-pollination is

- Individual research projects often answer multiple questions that aren’t in the scope of the study at the time. This is why having a smart system to capture, organize and search all your past data and key insights is critical.
    
- [https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-organize-share-user-research-data-insights-3-step-zack-naylor/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-organize-share-user-research-data-insights-3-step-zack-naylor/) 
    
-  In a meta-analysis, the results of individual studies are combined and analyzed to derive a summary estimate of the effect size of a particular intervention or predictor variable. This allows researchers to assess the consistency and generalizability of the results across studies, identify any discrepancies or inconsistencies, and determine the overall strength and significance of the relationship between variables.

Why is it important

- A lack of synthesis can lead researchers down the path of conducting the same research over and over again. 
    
- Objective of our insights: Timelessness and durability. 
    
- In the long-run, a lack of synthesis can be a detriment to user research, and ultimately, the user experience, product, and business strategy.

How to do it

- Create a research plan
    
- Define a problem statement
    
- Collect and analyze data
    
- Refine the problem statement by defining what still needs to be added.
    
- [https://medium.com/integrating-research/fighting-insight-waste-with-research-repositories-6a00cc450efd](https://medium.com/integrating-research/fighting-insight-waste-with-research-repositories-6a00cc450efd)

- persona/customer segment
    
- team/department
    
- global theme, or
    
- business goal

- The more streams of insights are woven into the synthesis the the better your understanding of the user and customer you’re representing with your products and experiences.
    
- The more article gathered and the richer, the more articulate the user insights will be. 
    
- Approach the research synthesis with questions. 
    

- What do you and your team want to uncover through the research synthesis?
    
- What about your stakeholders — what can they learn from your user research synthesis?
    
- What do you, your stakeholders, and your collaborators wish you knew more about users or customers?
    
- What are users’ needs when it comes to interacting with Product X or Product Y? What needs are being met? Are there new needs or gaps in our understanding of user needs?
    
- What have we learned about Product X or Product Y over the last 2 years? 5 years?
    
- What have we learned about customers using Product X and Product Y over the past 5 years? Have their needs changed over time?
    
- What user needs are most important when interacting with Products X and Y? What needs are less critical, but perhaps “delighters” or low-cost features or fixes that engineers and developers could address in their next sprint cycle?
    
- What are unmet or unidentified needs and pain points for users? What workarounds do users have in place to meet their needs when using your product?
    
- Prioritize our research questions
    

- What are the burning questions on the team? Of those research questions, which have the most impact on the user? What about impact on the team, the organization, or the business?
    
- What gaps in knowledge on the topic you’re researching have existed for quite some time across users, the business, or the team?
    
- What do collaborators and stakeholders really need to know now to guide product design or a larger strategic research effort?
    
- What is the impact of not answering some of these desk research questions?
    

- Reflect on what you built
    

- What are consistent themes across the streams of data and information you gathered?
    
- What are consistent user needs or user pain points emerging across scholarly articles or internal user reports? Why?
    
- What continues to be an unmet need or unaddressed user pain point over time? Why? What about across data streams? What does the qualitative research say? What about the quantitative research?
    
- What are new user insights? Do these contradict older user insights? Why?
    

- From here, start outlining your synthesis report. I prefer to organize by major research questions and the questions my stakeholders are asking.
    
- Organize the report by research question we can answer to. 
    
- Communicate the insights. Help insights get into a product a experience sprint backlog. Champion the insights. Share the work as much as possible
    
- a synthesis can be durable and long-lasting, it is a pool of knowledge that collaborators can return to over and over again for insight and direction.
    
- When we learn more about users and customers, and we gain new insights, this should be integrated into the synthesis.

Deductive or inductive tagging

- Deductive tagging: Making the tags before having read the insights. 
    

- See that as a shared language across the organization. 
    
- Products or services (webshop, app, store)
    
- Page or section (detail page, check-out, cash desk)
    
- Target group (prospects, persona, consumers, companies)
    
- Team/department (UX, marketing, customer service)
    
- Discipline (copy-writing, design, development)
    
- Tags for your user/customer
    
- Life events (marriage, moving out, first job)
    
- Journey step (orientation, browse, buy)
    
- Features or actions (filters, search, delivery, editing)
    
- Themes (Christmas, home, family)
    
- Tags for your research
    
- Device (desktop, mobile)
    
- Context (online, offline, social media)
    
- Research methods (analytics, interviews, survey)
    

- Inductive tagging: Making the tags after having read the insights. 
    

- Example: Look into the tags that are used the most and see how these can be categorized. 
    
- Most difficult part: Agree on the labels to use
    
- More efficient if you do not know what you are looking for 
    

Questions about the tags

- Will I gather enough data about this segmentation that I will need an overview of it? Or is this subject too narrow or too specific?
    
- Do I need this variation of a certain subject? Or are the variations so small there will be no significant difference between the insights you will gather?
    
- Is it really necessary to get an overview about this subject? Or do I only use it as a label, (like iOS or Android) but I won’t get interesting insights about this?

When to do it

- When UX Research synthesis can be useful:
    

- When we know we will carry desk research at the start of a project. 
    
- Current length of desk research: 1 week
    

- A lot is known about a particular space, product, or user, and we need to distill high-level themes from a wellspring of amassed knowledge
    
- Very little is known about a product, space, user, or phenomena — it’s a good time to scratch the surface and inform your research plans and protocols
    
- New lines of business and business strategies are beginning to emerge, and we want user research integrated into that strategy or effort early on
    

- [Using Research Synthesis to Build Better Products - UX Magazine](https://uxmag.com/articles/using-research-synthesis-to-build-better-products) 
    
- What to include
    

- Research project name
    
- Research findings
    
- Research recommendations
    

- Only log distinct insights. 
    
- If you find the same insight in 2 studies, just record the number of times this insight is appearing.
    
- [UX Research: Facing Ambiguity Head On](https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2018/05/ux-research-facing-ambiguity-head-on.php)
    
- Start by creating a global research taxonomy to categorise and index insights across studies. This exercise in itself will help uncover patterns, gaps and opportunities in your existing knowledge base. 
    
- Challenge yourself and your team to conduct quarterly reviews of new research – dedicating time to exercises such as affinity mapping to identify new threads and patterns when combined with your previous research findings.
