**# Cross-Pollination - V2

  
# What do we mean by cross-pollination?

- We refer to cross-pollination between UX Research studies as the fact of grouping insights, collating them from various studies in order to find patterns across them. 
    
- The method we use to do it is a literature review, systematic review or a meta-analysis. 
    
- The goal is to manage and distill our user insights. 
    

  

# Why did we initiate the insights hub and cross-pollination?

  

1. The issue
    

Issues that happen: 

- Sometimes UX Research projects answer multiple questions that are not in the scope of the study at the time. This is why having a smart system to capture, organize and search all your past data and key insights is critical.

While not necessarily problematic for informing products tactically, a lack of synthesis over time can lead researchers down a path of conducting the same research over and over again — moving the insights further away from timelessness and durability.

2. The research repository  
      
    

We are oftentimes led to share or reshare new information from past studies, answering questions such as:

- “What do we know about [fill in the blank]?”
    
- “Do we have any research on…[fill in the blank]?”
    

  

I bet those questions sound familiar. Having a user research repository of well organized projects and groups of key insights in an easily searched place helps you answer those questions almost effortlessly.

3. The need
    

  

- Imagine a workplace where every research request you receive takes into account what your organization already knows.
    
- Product teams have the answers to common UX questions at their fingertips, and finding insights has become second nature to everyone.
    
- You rarely wonder whether the insights you find are still true because other researchers are always adding new evidence that supports them.
    
- When a product manager asks me whether a push notification in a given circumstance will be too distracting, for example, I can run a search, pull up the most relevant insights on focus and distraction, and send them the link, accomplishing what might have been several days’ work—or even a whole redundant study—in a few minutes. Better yet, PMs and designers can learn to do this themselves.
    
- We only need two things to bring about this reality: 
    

- a library that traces connections between individual insights
    
- and a culture that supports its use.
    

  
  

To-do: 

- Linking the evidence to this insight repository (reels and reports)

# Why do we do it?

  

A synthesis supplements and compliments primary user research to form a deep, well-rounded understanding of our users and their experiences.

- The need to fundamentally understand users and generate a set of initial user needs to inform product design and development
    
- The need to integrate user and customer insights into business strategy and shape the direction of the business
    
- The need to deeply understand a topic that is core to the user experience with a product — say for instance how individuals come to trust technology, how people pay attention for prolonged periods of time, or how teams make critical decisions
    
- The need to articulate and archive numerous user insights in one place that are timeless and durable — these insights are an be used over to inform the user experience or product direction, establishing within the research.
    

  

- Insights from past studies can serve as a foundation for future studies and provide a high level overview of user behaviors and mental models.
    
- In order to achieve that, we cross-pollinate by summarizing and collating existing research to have a broader picture of users outside of specific studies.

There are a few cases in which a research synthesis can be highly impactful:

  

- A lot is known about a particular space, product, or user, and we need to distill high-level themes from a wellspring of amassed knowledge
    
- Very little is known about a product, space, user, or phenomena — it’s a good time to scratch the surface and inform your research plans and protocols
    
- New lines of business and business strategies are beginning to emerge, and we want user research integrated into that strategy or effort early on
    

Be strategic about thinking when to conduct your synthesis — look for gaps and impact points across the business where your work can gain traction.

# How do we do it?

  

1. Overview
    

  
  

- A research synthesis is built upon a mass of user insights, if done well, a synthesis includes insights from market research, sales, qualitative research, and quantitative research.
    
- The more streams of insight that are woven into the synthesis, the better — the better your understanding of the user and customer you’re representing with your products and experiences. When looking at a breadth of insights, we can begin to use synthesis to better understand users.

Scoping the need

  

- Some good questions to ask yourself when you initially prioritize and guide your search include:
    

- What are the burning questions on the team? Of those research questions, which have the most impact on the user? What about impact on the team, the organization, or the business?
    
- What gaps in knowledge on the topic you’re researching have existed for quite some time across users, the business, or the team?
    
- What do collaborators and stakeholders really need to know now to guide product design or a larger strategic research effort?
    
- What is the impact of not answering some of these desk research questions?
    

  
  
  

Generating User Questions

  

- What are users’ needs when it comes to interacting with Product X or Product Y? What needs are being met? Are there new needs or gaps in our understanding of user needs?
    
- What have we learned about Product X or Product Y over the last 2 years? 5 years?
    
- What have we learned about customers using Product X and Product Y over the past 5 years? Have their needs changed over time?
    
- What user needs are most important when interacting with Products X and Y? What needs are less critical, but perhaps “delighters” or low-cost features or fixes that engineers and developers could address in their next sprint cycle?
    
- What are unmet or unidentified needs and pain points for users? What workarounds do users have in place to meet their needs when using your product?

Searching

Hone your search criteria further by developing a core list of key search terms or keywords. Use the same key terms across your search tools (whether these be internal or external libraries) — this will help you maintain consistency and reduce the number of returns in your search.

2. Specifically
    

  

We can group key insights across multiple projects by:

- Product
    
- Feature
    
- Persona or Customer Segment
    
- Team or Department
    
- Global Theme or Topic
    
- Business Goal

Insights we are looking for

The ability to successfully manipulate and visualize data—and identify and interpret such patterns—forms a critical toolset for UX designers. Recognizing patterns in user research data provides designers with a way to accelerate and bolster the move from insight to design enhancement.

- trends—A trend is the gradual, general progression of data up or down.
    
- repetitions—A repetition is a series of values that repeat themselves.
    
- cycles—A cycle is a regularly recurring series of data.
    
- feedback systems—A feedback system is a cycle that gets progressively bigger or smaller because of some influence.
    
- clusters—A cluster is a concentration of data or objects in one small area.
    
- gaps—A gap is an area in which there is an absence of data.
    
- pathways—A pathway is a sequential pattern of data.
    
- exponential growth—In exponential growth, there is a rapidly increasing rate of growth.
    
- diminishing returns—When there are diminishing returns, there is a gradually decreasing rate of growth.
    
- long tails—The Long Tail is a pattern that rises steeply at the start, falls sharply, then levels off over a large range of low values.
    

Follow up questions

- What are consistent themes across the streams of data and information you gathered?
    
- What are consistent user needs or user pain points emerging across scholarly articles or internal user reports? Why?
    
- What continues to be an unmet need or unaddressed user pain point over time? Why? What about across data streams? What does the qualitative research say? What about the quantitative research?
    
- What are new user insights? Do these contradict older user insights? Why?
    

  

Next steps

Some helpful questions to ask yourself at this stage might include:

- What do your stakeholders need to know immediately?
    
- What questions can wait or be backlogged into another sprint or Version 2.0 of the product?
    
- What’s the impact to a user or customer if a particular research question is addressed now? What about if it is answered later?
