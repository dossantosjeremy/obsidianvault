Many discussions surrounding product managers and UX designers are positioned as PM vs. UX or explore who owns the product or is in charge. We’d suggest a different perspective. Instead of seeing the relationship between PM and UX as adversarial, it’s better to think of it as a collaboration of people with different, sometimes overlapping, skill sets who work together to achieve an outcome.

**How do product management and UX work together for business growth?** On the surface, UX (user experience) researchers and product managers (PMs) appear to have similar roles and goals. After all, they are both concerned with creating value-added products that users will love and rely on data-driven insights for decision-making. Although the roles overlap, the unique strengths of PMs and UXRs mean that collaboration between both is vital to a successful product development cycle.

**Product Manager vs. UX Designer: Who should be in charge?** A lot of people contribute to building and maintaining a product — from casting a bold vision for something new to building repeatable processes that support customers using it. At every stage of the product development process, individuals “own” some aspect of the complete product experience, yet overall everyone on the product team is responsible for understanding customers and delivering value to them.

**How designers and product managers can build a stronger relationship.** Delivering products with delightful user experiences is a winning formula for good business. A poorly designed product might technically solve a user’s problems but provide a frustrating experience, which can lead to the user looking for alternative solutions. Good design leads to positive user feedback and reviews, better customer retention and industry adoption.
